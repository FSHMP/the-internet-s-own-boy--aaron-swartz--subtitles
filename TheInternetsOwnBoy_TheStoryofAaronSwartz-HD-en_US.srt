00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,790
It's very simple to write a subtitle

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,790
You just have to specify the time when you want the text to be displayed

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,790
You can use <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>!

00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,321
Make sure you display the sentence long enough to be read :)

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,321
Keep sentences less than 2 lines, they might become longer when translated in other languages

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
Unjust laws exist;

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,600
shall we be content to obey them,

00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,600
or shall we endeavor to amend them,
and obey them until we have succeeded,

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,600
or shall we transgress them at once?

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,000
Henry David Thoreau

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,000
The co-founder of the social news and entertainment website "reddit" has been found dead

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,300
He surely was a prodigy althought he never [?] thought of himself like that

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was totally unexcited about studing businesses and making money

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a profound sense of loss tonight in Highland Park Aaron Swartz's hometown

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,000
as loved ones say goodbye to one of the Internet's brightest lights

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,500
...Open Access and computer activits are mourning his loss

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
...an astonishing intellect. You talk to people who knew him 

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
...he was killed by the government and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,100
...they wanted to make an example out of it, ok?

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Governments have sensational[?] desire to confront

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,700
...he was potentially facing 35 years in prison and 1 million dollars fine

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Raising questions of prosecutorial zeal and I would say even miscondut.

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Have you looked into that particular matter and reached any conclusions?


00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Growing up, you know, I slowly had this process of realising that 

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
all the things around me, that people had told me

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,900
were just the natural way things were, the way things always would be.

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
They weren't natural at all. They were things that could be changed

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,800
and they were thing that more importantly were wrong and should change.

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,600
And once I realised that, there was really kind of no going back

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Internet's Own Boy

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Welcome to story reading time

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
The name of the book is 'Paddington at the fair'

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Well, he was born in Highland Park and grew up here

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Aaron came from a family of three brothers all extraordinarly bright

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
The box is flipping over! 

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,500
So, we were all, you know, not the best behaved children

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,100
you know, three boys running around all the time, causing trouble

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Mom: No, no, no... Aaron!?
Aaron: What?

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,700
But, I've come to the realization: Aaron learned how to learn at a very young age


00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,700
Toc, toc!?

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Who's here?

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Aaron!

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Aaron who?

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,500
Aaron funny man

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
He knew what he wanted, he always wanted to do it. 
He always accomplished what he wanted.

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
His curiosity was endless

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,500
Here's the little picture of a [?] [?]


00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
One day he said to Susan: "Let's do three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park"

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
He was three at the time

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
She said: "What are you talking about?"

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,000
He said: "Look it says here on on the refrigerator"

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000
"Three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park"

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,800
She was flurred and astonished that he could read

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,800
It's called: "My family seder"

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,800
The seder night is different from all other nights

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,700
I remember once we were are the University of Chicago library

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,100
I pulled a book off the shelf that was like from 1900

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,000
and showed to him, [?]you know this is an extraordinary place

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,000
We all were curious children but Aaron really liked learning and really liked teaching

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Today we're going to read the ABC backwards z, y, x, w, ...

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
I remember he came home from his first algebra class

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,000
he was like: "Noah, let me teach you algebra!"

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
and I'm like: "What is algebra?"

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
and he was always like that

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Now I press button, click button

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,500
there, now he's got that[?], now it's a pink

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When he was at 2 or 3 three years old an Bob introduced him to computers

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,700
then he just took off like crazy on them

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
[?]

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,900
We all had computers, but Aaron really talked to them, really talked to the Internet

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,500
Looking at the computer?

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,900
No, how [?]

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
He started programming from a really young age.

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,800
I remember the first program that I wrote with him was in basic

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
and  was a Star Wars trivia game

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,500
He sat down with me in the basement were the computer was

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
for hours programming this game 

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The problem that I kept having with him was that 
there was nothing that I woudn't done 

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,500
and to him there'sat always something to do
always something that programming could solve 


00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,900
The way that Aaron always thought is that programming is magic

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you can accomplish this things that normal humans can't

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Aaron made an ATM using like a Macintosh and like a cardboard box

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,700
One year for Halloween I didn't know what I wanted to be 

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,600
and he thought would be really really cool if I dressed up

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,800
like his new favourite computer which at the time was the original iMac

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,500
and he hated dressing up for Hallowen but he loved convincing other people to dress like other things he wanted to see

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
[?]
Guys, come on, look at the camera

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,000
He made this website called "The Info" where people could just fill in information

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Like, I'm sure someone out there knows all about gold, gold leafing[?].

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Why aren't they writing about that on this website?

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then other people can come at a later point and read that information 

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,500
and edit the information if they thought that it was bad

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,000
Not too dissimilar from WikiPedia, all right?

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,500
This is before WikiPedia begun

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
and this is developed by a 12 year old 

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,600
in his room, by himself

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,200
running on this tiny server using ancient technology

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,800
One of the teacher's response like:

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,500
"This is a terrible idea, you can't just let anyone author the dictionary, like author the encyclopedia"

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,200
"For a whole reason we have scholars to write these book for us" 

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,200
"How did you ever had such a terrible idea"

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Me and my other brother would be like: "Yeah, you know"

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,800
"WikiPedia is cool but we had that in our house, like 5 years ago"

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:30,000
Aaron's website "The Info.org" wins a school competition hosted by the Cambridge based web design firm ArsDigita

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,900
We all went to Cambridge when he won the ArsDigita Prize

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
and, you know, we had no clue of what Aaron was doing

00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:43,500
it was obvious that the pirze was really important

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,700
Aaron soon became involved with on-line programming communities

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
than in the process of shaping a new tool for web

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,800
He concept is like[?]: "Ben, there's a really awesome thing that I'm working on"

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,700
"you need to hear about it"

00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm like: "Yeah, what is it?"

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
He says: "Is this thing called RSS"

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,700
And he explains me what RSS is

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,500
and I like: "Why is that useful? Aaron, is a site using it? Why would I want to use it?"

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
There was this mailing list for people who were working on RSS and XML more generally

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,300
and there was a person on it named Aaron Swartz 

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,600
who was combatitive but very smart and who had lots of good ideas

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
and he did never come to the face to face meetings

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and they said: "You know, when are you gonna come to one of those face to face meetings?" 

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,300
He said: "You know, I don't think my mom would let me, you know I just turned 14"

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,900
So the first reaction was, well you know, this person this colleague we've been working with all year 

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,800
was 13 years old when we were working with him and is only 14 now

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,700
and their second reaction was: "Christ, we really want to meet him!"

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
"You know that's extraordinary"

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,900
Was part of the community that drafted RSS

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,700
What he was doing was to help building the plumbing for modern hypertext

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,800
and the piece he was working on, RSS, was a tool that you can use to get summaries

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,500
of things that are going on on other web pages

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,700
Commonly you would use this for a blog 

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,100
You might have 10 or 20 people's blog you wanna read 

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,800
you use the RSS feeds, these summaries of what's going on on those other pages 

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,400
to create a unified list of all the stuff that's going on

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Aaron was really young but he understood the technology

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
and he saw that was imperfect and looked for ways to help make it better 

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,800 
So his mom bundles[?] him on a plane in Chicago, we pick him up in San Francisco 

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,800
we introduced him to interesting people to argue with

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
and we marvelled at his horrific eating habits

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
he only eat white food, only like, you know, steamed rice

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,800
and not white rice, beacause that was not sufficiently white, and white bread, and so on

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and you kind of marvel at the quality of the debate emerging from what appeared to be a small boy's mouth 

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,600
and you think, this is a kid, is really going to go somewhere if he doesn't die of scroovy[?]


00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,600
Aaron you're up

00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:06,800
I think the difference is that now you can't make companies like that per-se

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,800
you can't have companies that just like "let's sell dog food over the Internet, dog food over the cellphones"

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
but there still lot of innovation going on, I think, if you don't see the innovation maybe your head is in the sand


00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
He takes on this alpha-male personality where he's sort of like 

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,700
"I'm smarter than you, and because I'm smarter than you I'm better than you, and I can tell you what to do"

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
It's an extension of him being like a kind of torpe[?]

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
So you aggregate all these computers together and now they're solving big problems

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,000
like searching for aliens or trying to cure cancer


00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,600
First I met him on IRC, on Internet Relay Chat, he didn't just write code 

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,600
he also got people excited about solving problems, he was a connector

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
the free culture movement, which[?] had lot of his energy

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,600
I think Aaron was trying to make the world work.
He was trying to fix it


00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
He had a very kind of strong personality, that definetly ruffled[?] feathers at times

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,500
and wasn't necessarily the case that he was always confortable in the world

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
and the world wasn't confortable with him

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,900
Aaron got into high school, and was really just sick of school

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
he didn't like it, he didn't like any of the classes he had been taught

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
he didn't like the teachers

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,700
Aaron really knew how to get information

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,200
He was like, I don't need to go to these teachers to know how to do geometry

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I can just read the geometry book

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,400
and I don't need to go to the teacher to learn their version of American history 

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,800
I have like three historical compilations here like I can just read them

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
and I'm not interested in that, I'm interested in the Web


00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
I was very frustrated with school

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,300
I thought, you know, the teachers didn't know what they were talking about

[position]

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,700
they were very domineering and controlling, homework was kind of a sham[?]

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,500
I was just like, you know, all the way are penstick[?] together and force them to do busy work

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,500
and, you know, I started reading books about the history of education and how this educational system was developed

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,300
and, you know, alternative ways to do it[?] people could actually learn things 

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,700
instead of just regurgitating facts that the teachers told them

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,700
and that kind of led me down this path of questioning things

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
and once I questioned the school I was in, I questioned the society that built the school

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,200
I questioned the businesses that the schools were training people for

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I questioned the government that, you know, setup this whole structure 

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,300
One of the themes he was more passionate about was copyright, especially in those early days 

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Copyright has always been something overburden on publishing industry and on readers

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,900
but it wasn't an excessive burden

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,200
it was a reasonable institution to have in place
to make sure that people got paid

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,100
What Aaron generation experienced was the collision

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
between this antique copyright system

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,700
and this amazing new thing we were trying to build, the Internet and the Web

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,000
These things collided and what we got was chaos


00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
He then met Harward law professot Lawrence Lessig

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,700
who was then challenging copyright law in the supreme court

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,200
A young Aaron Swartz flew to Washington to listen to the supreme court hearings

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm Aaron Swartz and I'm here to listen to the Eldred ...to see the Eldred argument

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,000
Why did you fly out here from Chicago and come all this way to see the Eldred argument?

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
That's a more difficult question

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,700
I don't know, I'm very excited to see the supreme court 

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
especially in such a prestigious case as this one

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Lessig was also moving forward with a new way to define copyright on the Internet

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,800
it was called Creative Commons

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,800
So the simple idea of Creative Commons is to give people, creators

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
a simple way to mark their creativity

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,600
with the freedoms they intended to carry

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
So copyright is about "all rights reserved"

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
then this is a kind of "some rights reserved" bottle[?]

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,400
It's I want a simple way to say to you "here's what you can do with my work"

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,800
even if there are other things which you need to get my permission before you could do

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,400
And Aaron's role was the computer part

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
like how do you architect the licenses 

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,300
so that would be simple and understandable and expressed in way that machines could process it

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
And people are like, why do you have this fifteen year old kid

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,000
writing the specifications of creative commons?

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
like, don't you think that's a huge mistake?

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
and larry is like: "the biggest mistake that we would have is not listening to this kid"

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,200
embarrassing[?] is not even tall enough to get over the podium

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,300
and it wasn't one of those movable podiums

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,600
so this embarrassing thing that once he put his screen up nobody could see his face

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,000
When we come to our website here

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,500
and we've got few licences 

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,600
it gives you this list of options explaining what it means

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
and we thought three set of questions

00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
Do you want to require attribution?

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,600
Do you want to allow commercial uses of your work?

00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,700
Do you want to allow modifications of your work?

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,900
I was floored

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,800
just completely fiberglassed that these adults regarded him as an adult

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Aaron stood up there in front an whole audience full of people 

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and just started talking about the platform that he created for Creative Commons

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
And they where all listening to him, just

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,600
I was sitting AT the back thinking: 
"he's just a kid, why're listening to him?"

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,700
but they did

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
well I don't think I comprehended it fully

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Though critics have said that it does little to ensure artists get payed for their work

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
the success of Creative Commons has been enourmous

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Currently on the website flickr alone over 200 million people use some form of Creative Commons license

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,400
He contributed through his technical abilities 

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,600
and yet it was not simply a technical matter to him

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600 
Aaron Often wrote candidly in his personal blog

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,600 
I think deeply about things and I want others to do likewise.

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,800 
I work for ideas and learn from people. I don’t like excluding people. 

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,800 
I’m a perfectionist, but I won’t let that get in the way of publication.

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,300 
Except for education and entertainment, I’m not going to waste my time on things that won’t have impact. 

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,800 
I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don’t take me seriously. 

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,800
I don’t hold grudges (it’s not productive) but I learn from my experience. 

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I want to make the world a better place.

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,700
In 2004 Swartz leaves Highland Park and enrolls in Stanford University 

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
He had also diverticolite[?] which was very troubling 

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
and we were concerned about him taking his medications.

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
He got hospitalized and he would take this cocktail pills everyday

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,200
and one of these pills was a steroid which dauted his growth and 

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,600
made him feel different from any of the other students

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Aaron, I think, shows up at Stanford ready to scholarship

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,600
and find himself effectively in a baby sitting program for overachieving high school-ers

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,300
who in four years meant to become captain of industry and one percent-ers

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,600
and I think it just made him banana

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,900
In 2005 after only one year of college

<<<<<<< HEAD
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:32,200
Swartz was offered a spot at a new startup incubation firm

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,500
called Y Combinator led by Paul Graham

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,500
He's like, "hey, I have this idea for a web site"

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,200
and Paul Graham likes him enough and

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,400
so yeah, sure, so Aaron drops out of school to this apartment

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,900
So this used to be Aaron apartment when he lived here

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,00
my big memories of my father telling me how difficult it was to get a lease

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
cause Aaron had no credit and dropped out of college

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Aaron lived in what[?] called the living room

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,000
and some of the posters here are left over from when Aaron lived here

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,800
and the library, there were[?] more books then, but a lot of them are Aaron's

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,400
Aaron YCombinator site is called "infogami" a tool to build websites

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
but infogami struggles to find users

00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,600
and Swartz eventually merges his company with another Y Combinator project in need of help

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,700
it was a project led by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian called "reddit"

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,900
Now we were starting from almost nothing, no users, no money, no code

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
and growing day by day into hugely popular website

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
and it shows no sign of letting up

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,600
first we had a thousand users, than 10.000, then 20.000 and on and on, it's just incredible

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,000
reddit becomes huge and it's a real sort of geeky corner of the Internet

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,100
There's a lot of humor, there's a lot of art

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,100
and there's just people who flocked to the site

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,500
and made that site the main site they go to every morning to get their news.

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,500
"reddit" kind of just borders on chaos at some level, so on the one hand its a place for people to discuss

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,800
...news of the day, technology, politics and issues and yet there is a lot of kind of not safe for work

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,800
...material, offensive material. Some subreddits were "trolls", "find a welcome home"

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,800
and so in that sense reddit has been home to controversies as well

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
It's kind of sits on the edge of chaos. 

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,800
reddit catches the attention of the corporate magazine giant "Condé Nast"

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
...who makes an offer to buy the company. 

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,700
Some large amount of money,

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
large enough that my dad was getting bugged with questions about like

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,300
"How do I... store this money?"

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,500
Like a lot of money

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,800
Like a lot of money

00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,200
Like... probably more than a million dollars. But I don't actually know.

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
And he's how old then?

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,200
Nineteen or twenty?

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:13,500
So he was in this apartment, they are like sat around on [?] couch hacking on "reddit" and...

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,300
when they sold reddit they threw giant party and then all flew out to California

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
the next day they left the keys with me.

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,800
It was funny you know, he just sold a startup so we all kind of presumed he was the richest person around...

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,100
but he.. ah.. he said "Oh, no. I'll take this tiny little shoe box sized room, that's all I need"

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:42,500
...like he was barely larger than a closet. The idea of him spending his money on fancy objects just seems so implausible. 

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,900
He explains it like, I like living in apartments,

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,900
so I'm not gonna spend lot of money on a new place to live, I'm not gonna buy a mansion

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,500
... and I like wearning jeans and t-shirt, so I am not gonna spend any more money on clothes. So like, it's really no big deal."

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,500
What is a big deal to Swartz is how traffic flows on the Internet and what commands our attention?

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,800
In the old system of broadcasting you're fundamentally limited by the amount of space in the airwaves.

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,500
You know, you could always send out 10 channels over the airwaves for televisions right away

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
even with cables you have 500 channels. On the Internet everybody can have a channel.

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,800
Everyone can get a blog or a myspace page. Everyone has a way of expressing themselves. 

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
And so what you see now is not a question of 

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,800
"who gets access to the airwaves?". It's the question of "who gets control over the ways you find people?"

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,500
You know you started seeing power centralizing in sites like Google, these sort of gate keepers< that tell you

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,500
where on the internet where you want to go. The people who provides you, your sources of news information.

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,500
So it's not you know, only certain people have a license to speak now everyone has a license to speak

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,300
It's a question of "who gets heard?"

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,700
After he started working, in San Fransico at Condé Nast, he comes into the office

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,500
and they want to give him a computer with all this crap installed on it and say that he can't

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,400
install any new things on this computer, which to a developer is outrageous, right?

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,800
From the first day he was complaining about all this sutff.

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Gray wall, gray desks, gray noise. The first day I showed up here, I simply couldn't take it.

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,800
By lunch time I had literally locked myself in a bathroom stall and started crying.

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,600
I can't imagine staying sane with someone buzzing in my ear all day, let alone getting

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,400
any actual work done. Nobody else seems to get work done either. Everybody's

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,800
is always coming into our room to hang out and chat or invite us to play the new

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,500
video game system that wired is testing.

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,600
He really had different aspirations, that were politically oriented and Silicon valley

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,600
just doesn't really quite have that culture that orients technical activity for the purposes

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,200
of political goals. Aaron hated working for a corporation. They all hated

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,100
working for Condé Nast but Aaron is like the only one who is not going to take it.

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,800
And then basically he got himself fired by not showing up to work ever.

01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,954
he was emotionally vulnerable.

01:31:03,204 --> 01:31:06,837
And that was something they really needed to keep in mind, so that.. they knew that.

01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,845
It was weighing on him very heavily.

01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:15,264
He did not like having his actions and movements restricted in any way.

01:31:15,514 --> 01:31:20,640
And threat of jail, which they pounded him with a lot...

01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,712
.. was terrifying to him.

01:31:23,962 --> 01:31:27,509
Completley exhausted his financial resources and ...

01:31:27,759 --> 01:31:32,032
.. it cost us a lot of money also and he raised a substantial amount of money.

01:31:32,282 --> 01:31:36,128
So, you know, it was in millions of dollars.

01:31:36,378 --> 01:31:38,197
Interviewer: The legal defence?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

01:31:38,447 --> 01:31:40,288
Interviewer: Was it millions?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:44,957
Yea, I think he didn't want to be a burden to people. I think that was a factor

01:31:45,207 --> 01:31:49,546
Like I have my normal life, and I have this shitty thing I have to deal with.

01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:52,896
And I try to keep the two of them as seperate as possible.

01:31:53,146 --> 01:31:57,184
But they were just begining to blur together and everything was becoming shitty.

01:31:59,196 --> 01:32:02,410
Swartz faced a tough choice that was only getting tougher.

01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:06,741
To admit guilt and move on with your life or do you fight a broken system.

01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:12,608
With his legal case the answer was simple. He rejects the final plea deal and a trial date is set.

01:32:12,858 --> 01:32:16,106
Aaron was resolute that he didn't want to knuckle under..

01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:18,816
... and accept something that he didnt believe was fair.

01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,949
But I also think that he was scared.

01:32:32,789 --> 01:32:34,325
I don't think they would have convicted Aaron.

01:32:34,575 --> 01:32:38,549
I think we would have walked him out of that courthouse and I would have given him a big hug..

01:32:38,799 --> 01:32:42,944
.. and we would have walked across that little river in Boston and gone and had a couple of beers.

01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:51,136
I really thought that we were right. I thought we were gonna win the case. I thought we could win the case.

01:32:51,386 --> 01:32:55,840
He didn't talk about it very much but you could see the enourmous pain he was going through.

01:33:01,162 --> 01:33:06,624
No time in his childhood did Aaron have any severe mood swings, or like depressive episodes...

01:33:06,624 --> 01:33:10,592
.. or anything that I would describe to as severe depression.

01:33:10,842 --> 01:33:13,322
And its possible you know he was depressed. People get depressed

01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:24,117
Very early in our relationship, like 3 or 4 weeks in or something..

01:33:24,367 --> 01:33:29,962
.. I remember his saying to me that "I was a lot stronger than he was.

01:33:30,517 --> 01:33:36,362
You know, he was brittle in lot of ways. Things were a lot harder for him than for a lot of people.

01:33:36,405 --> 01:33:38,304
It was part of his brilliance too.

01:33:40,778 --> 01:33:47,456
I think, he probably had something like clinical depression in his early 20s...

01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:49,378
.. I don't think he did when I was with him.

01:33:49,628 --> 01:33:53,770
He wasn't a joyful person.... but that's different from being depressed.

01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:00,832
He was just under such such enourmous pressure for two years straight.

01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,816
He just didn't want to do it anymore.

01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:07,296
He was just.. I think it was too much.

01:34:13,942 --> 01:34:16,042
I got a phone call late at night.

01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:22,421
I could tell something was wrong and then I called and I realized what had happened.

01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:28,970
A cofounder of the social news and entertainment website Reddit has been found dead.

01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:34,026
Police say 26 yr old Aaron Swartz killed himself yesterday in his Brooklyn apartment.

01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:46,464
i just thought we've lost one of the most creative minds of our generation.

01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,728
I was like the whole world fell apart at that moment.

01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,114
It was one of the hardest nights of my life.

01:35:00,117 --> 01:35:03,914
It was like I was screaming "I can't hear you.. what did you just say.. I can't hear you."

01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:11,765
I can't. Thats it.

01:35:19,978 --> 01:35:23,712
None of it made any sense. And really still doesn't.

01:35:24,693 --> 01:35:27,488
I was so frustrated and angry.

01:35:38,154 --> 01:35:41,120
You know I tried to explain it to my kids.

01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:46,325
My 3 yr old told me that the doctors would fix him.

01:35:52,021 --> 01:35:56,160
I know lots of people who have died but I've never lost anybody like this.

01:35:56,245 --> 01:36:03,050
Because everybody feels, and I do too, there is so much that we could've.. more to do.

01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:10,059
I just didn't know that he was there. I didn't know this is what he was suffering.

01:36:11,242 --> 01:36:13,601
He was part of me.

01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:19,328
And I just wanted it to not be real.

01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:27,989
And then I just looked at his Wikipedia page and I saw the end date.

01:36:32,065 --> 01:36:34,944
02-02-2013

01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:17,653
My first thought was what if nobody even notices.

01:37:18,805 --> 01:37:22,913
It wasn't clear to me how salient he was.

01:37:23,818 --> 01:37:29,749
I had never seen anything quite like the outpouring I saw.

01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,242
The net just lit up.

01:37:31,498 --> 01:37:39,861
Everyone was trying to explain it in their own way but I have never seen people grieve on Twitter before.

01:37:39,968 --> 01:37:42,549
People were visibily grieving online.

01:37:46,465 --> 01:37:51,253
He was the Internet's Own Boy... and the whole world killed him.

01:37:55,328 --> 01:38:00,277
We are standing in the middle of a time when great injustice is not touched.

01:38:01,962 --> 01:38:05,397
Architects of financial meltdown have dinner with the President [?].

01:38:06,186 --> 01:38:13,568
In middle of that time the idea that this was what the government had to prosecute.

01:38:14,528 --> 01:38:17,642
It just seems absurd, if it weren't tragic.

01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:25,258
The question is can we do something, given what's happened, to make the world a better place.

01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:30,485
And how can we further that legacy. Thats the only question one can ask.

01:38:32,929 --> 01:38:38,421
All over the world there are starting to be hackathons, gatherings, and Aaron Swartz...

01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:45,034
.. has in some sense brought the best out us, in trying to say how do we fix this.

01:38:47,137 --> 01:38:54,433
Roy Singham:  He was in my humble opinion one of the true extraordinary revolutionaries that this country has produced.

01:38:54,954 --> 01:39:00,000
I don't know weather Aaron was defeated or victorious, but

01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:04,277
We are certainly shaped by the hand of the things

01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:05,877
that he wrestled with.

01:39:06,127 --> 01:39:08,692
When we turned armed agents of the law

01:39:08,821 --> 01:39:12,192
on citizens trying to increase access to knowledge

01:39:12,442 --> 01:39:14,133
we've broken the rule of law

01:39:14,383 --> 01:39:16,778
and we've desecrated the temple of justice.

01:39:17,028 --> 01:39:19,530
Aaron Swartz was not a criminal.

01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,309
Change does not role in on the wheels..

01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:25,440
.. of inevitability.

01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:27,700
It comes through continous struggle.

01:39:30,026 --> 01:39:31,690
Aaron really could do magic

01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,900
and I am dedicated to making sure...

01:39:34,095 --> 01:39:35,936
... his magic doesn't end with his death.

01:39:36,186 --> 01:39:37,664
He believed that he could change the world.

01:39:37,914 --> 01:39:39,498
And he was right.

01:39:39,748 --> 01:39:42,549
Out of the last week, and out of today..

01:39:42,799 --> 01:39:44,832
.. phoenixes are already rising.

01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:49,141
Since Swartz's death...

01:39:48,693 --> 01:39:51,637
.. Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Sen. Ron Wyden..

01:39:51,887 --> 01:39:53,536
have introduced legislations that would reform

01:39:53,786 --> 01:39:55,370
... the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:58,741
The outdated law that formed the majority of the charges..

01:39:58,991 --> 01:39:59,936
against Swartz.

01:40:00,186 --> 01:40:02,389
It's called "Aaron's Law."

01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,802
Aaron believed that like you literally ought to..

01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:07,424
.. be asking yourself all the time..

01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:11,157
.. "what is the most thing i could be working on in the world right now?"

01:40:11,407 --> 01:40:13,269
And if you are not working on that, why aren't you?

01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:37,098
I wish we could change the past, but we cannot.

01:40:37,348 --> 01:40:43,605
But we can change the future and we must. We must do so for Aaron. We must do so for ourselves.

01:40:43,855 --> 01:40:48,469
We must do so to make our world a better place.. a more humane place.

01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,304
A place where justice works.

01:40:50,554 --> 01:40:54,272
And access to knowledge becomes a human right.

01:40:54,522 --> 01:40:59,413
So there was a kid, back in feburary from Baltimore.

01:40:59,663 --> 01:41:01,504
14 years old.

01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:08,352
..who had access to JStor and he had been splunking through JStor after reading something.

01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:13,365
And he figured out a way to do early tests for Pancreatic Cancer.

01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,037
And Pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you.

01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:22,560
Because we detect it way to late. By the time we detect its already too late to do anything about that.

01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:28,725
And, he sent e-mails off to entire Oncology department at John Hopkins..

01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:31,434
you know hundereds of them.
Interviewer: A 14 year old?

01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,610
14 year old kid yeah. And most of them ignored it.

01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,594
But one of them, like, sent him a e-mail back

01:41:35,844 --> 01:41:38,100
And said, "this is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over."

01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:43,189
This kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher and in Feburary I heard him on the news..

01:41:43,466 --> 01:41:46,794
.. just couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot.

01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,200
Sorry.

01:41:53,344 --> 01:41:58,997
And he said, the reason he was on the news is because they had done it.

01:41:59,247 --> 01:42:03,200
They were shipping an early test for pancreatic cancer that was gonna save lives.

01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:07,744
And he said, "This is why what Aaron did was so important."

01:42:10,496 --> 01:42:12,224
Because you never know, right.

01:42:12,245 --> 01:42:17,024
This truth of the universe is not only something that policy makers use to figure out...

01:42:17,274 --> 01:42:19,029
.. you know, what the speed limit should be.

01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:25,258
Its where the things thats gonna keep, your kid from dying of Pancreatic cancer comes from.

01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:31,146
And, without access the person who might come up with the thing thats got your

01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:34,901
number on it may never find that answer.

01:43:00,000 --> 01:44:59,525
