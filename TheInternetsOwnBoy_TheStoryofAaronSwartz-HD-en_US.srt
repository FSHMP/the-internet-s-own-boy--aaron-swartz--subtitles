00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,790
It's very simple to write a subtitle

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,790
You just have to specify the time when you want the text to be displayed

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,790
You can use <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>!

00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,321
Make sure you display the sentence long enough to be read :)

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,321
Keep sentences less than 2 lines, they might become longer when translated in other languages

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
Unjust laws exist;

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,600
shall we be content to obey them,

00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,600
or shall we endeavor to amend them,
and obey them until we have succeeded,

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,600
or shall we transgress them at once?

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,000
Henry David Thoreau

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,000
The co-founder of the social news and entertainment website "reddit" has been found dead

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,300
He surely was a prodigy althought he never kind of thought of himself like that

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was totally unexcited about studing businesses and making money

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a profound sense of loss tonight in Highland Park Aaron Swartz's hometown

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,000
as loved ones say goodbye to one of the Internet's brightest lights

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,500
...Open Access and computer activits are mourning his loss

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
...an astonishing intellect. You talk to people who knew him 

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
...he was killed by the government and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,100
...they wanted to make an example out of it, ok?

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Governments have sensational[?] desire to confront

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,700
...he was potentially facing 35 years in prison and 1 million dollars fine

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Raising questions of prosecutorial zeal and I would say even miscondut.

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Have you looked into that particular matter and reached any conclusions?


00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Growing up, you know, I slowly had this process of realising that 

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
all the things around me, that people had told me

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,900
were just the natural way things were, the way things always would be.

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
They weren't natural at all. They were things that could be changed

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,800
and they were thing that more importantly were wrong and should change.

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,600
And once I realised that, there was really kind of no going back

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Internet's Own Boy

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Welcome to story reading time

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
The name of the book is 'Paddington at the fair'

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Well, he was born in Highland Park and grew up here

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Aaron came from a family of three brothers all extraordinarly bright

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
The box is flipping over! 

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,500
So, we were all, you know, not the best behaved children

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,100
you know, three boys running around all the time, causing trouble

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Mom: No, no, no... Aaron!?
Aaron: What?

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,700
But, I've come to the realization: Aaron learned how to learn at a very young age


00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,700
Toc, toc!?

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Who's here?

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Aaron!

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Aaron who?

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,500
Aaron funny man

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
He knew what he wanted, he always wanted to do it. 
He always accomplished what he wanted.

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
His curiosity was endless

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,500
Here's the little picture of a [?] [?]


00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
One day he said to Susan: "Let's do three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park"

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
He was three at the time

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
She said: "What are you talking about?"

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,000
He said: "Look it says here on on the refrigerator"

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000
"Three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park"

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,800
She was flurred and astonished that he could read

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,800
It's called: "My family seder"

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,800
The seder night is different from all other nights

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,700
I remember once we were are the University of Chicago library

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,100
I pulled a book off the shelf that was like from 1900

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,000
and showed to him, I said: "You know this is [?] an extraordinary place"

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,000
We all were curious children but Aaron really liked learning and really liked teaching

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Today we're going to read the ABC backwards z, y, x, w, ...

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
I remember he came home from his first algebra class

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,000
he was like: "Noah, let me teach you algebra!"

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
and I'm like: "What is algebra?"

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
and he was always like that

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Now I press button, click button

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,500
there, now he's got that[?], now it's a pink

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When he was at 2 or 3 three years old an Bob introduced him to computers

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,700
then he just took off like crazy on them

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
[?]

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,900
We all had computers, but Aaron really talked to them, really talked to the Internet

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,500
Looking at the computer?

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,900
No, how [?]

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
He started programming from a really young age.

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,800
I remember the first program that I wrote with him was in basic

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
and  was a Star Wars trivia game

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,500
He sat down with me in the basement were the computer was

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
for hours programming this game 

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The problem that I kept having with him was that 
there was nothing that I woudn't done 

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,500
and to him there was always something to do
always something that programming could solve 

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,900
The way that Aaron always thought is that programming is magic

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you can accomplish this things that normal humans can't

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Aaron made an ATM using like a Macintosh and like a cardboard box

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,700
One year for Halloween I didn't know what I wanted to be 

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,600
and he thought would be really really cool if I dressed up

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,800
like his new favourite computer which at the time was the original iMac

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,500
and he hated dressing up for Hallowen but he loved convincing other people to dress like other things he wanted to see

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
[?]
Guys, come on, look at the camera

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,000
He made this website called "The Info" where people could just fill in information

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Like, I'm sure someone out there knows all about gold, gold leafing[?].

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Why aren't they writing about that on this website?

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then other people can come at a later point and read that information 

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,500
and edit the information if they thought that it was bad

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,000
Not too dissimilar from Wikipedia, all right?

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,500
This is before Wikipedia begun

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
and this is developed by a 12 year old 

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,600
in his room, by himself

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,200
running on this tiny server using ancient technology

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,800
One of the teacher's response like:

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,500
"This is a terrible idea, you can't just let anyone author the dictionary, like author the encyclopedia"

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,200
"For a whole reason we have scholars to write these book for us" 

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,200
"How did you ever had such a terrible idea"

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Me and my other brother would be like: "Yeah, you know"

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,800
"Wikipedia is cool but we had that in our house, like 5 years ago"

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:30,000
Aaron's website "The Info.org" wins a school competition hosted by the Cambridge based web design firm ArsDigita

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,900
We all went to Cambridge when he won the ArsDigita Prize

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
and, you know, we had no clue of what Aaron was doing

00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:43,500
it was obvious that the pirze was really important

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,700
Aaron soon became involved with on-line programming communities

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
than in the process of shaping a new tool for web

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,800
He concept is like[?]: "Ben, there's a really awesome thing that I'm working on"

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,700
"you need to hear about it"

00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm like: "Yeah, what is it?"

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
He says: "Is this thing called RSS"

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,700
And he explains me what RSS is

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,500
and I like: "Why is that useful? Aaron, is a site using it? Why would I want to use it?"

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
There was this mailing list for people who were working on RSS and XML more generally

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,300
and there was a person on it named Aaron Swartz 

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,600
who was combatitive but very smart and who had lots of good ideas

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
and he did never come to the face to face meetings

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and they said: "You know, when are you gonna come to one of those face to face meetings?" 

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,300
He said: "You know, I don't think my mom would let me, you know I just turned 14"

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,900
So the first reaction was, well you know, this person this colleague we've been working with all year 

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,800
was 13 years old when we were working with him and is only 14 now

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,700
and their second reaction was: "Christ, we really want to meet him!"

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
"You know that's extraordinary"

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,900
Was part of the community that drafted RSS

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,700
What he was doing was to help building the plumbing for modern hypertext

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,800
and the piece he was working on, RSS, was a tool that you can use to get summaries

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,500
of things that are going on on other web pages

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,700
Commonly you would use this for a blog 

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,100
You might have 10 or 20 people's blog you wanna read 

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,800
you use the RSS feeds, these summaries of what's going on on those other pages 

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,400
to create a unified list of all the stuff that's going on

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Aaron was really young but he understood the technology

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
and he saw that was imperfect and looked for ways to help make it better 

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,800 
So his mom bundles[?] him on a plane in Chicago, we pick him up in San Francisco 

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,800
we introduced him to interesting people to argue with

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
and we marvelled at his horrific eating habits

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
he only eat white food, only like, you know, steamed rice

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,800
and not white rice, beacause that was not sufficiently white, and white bread, and so on

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and you kind of marvel at the quality of the debate emerging from what appeared to be a small boy's mouth 

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,600
and you think, this is a kid, is really going to go somewhere if he doesn't die of scroovy[?]


00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,600
Aaron you're up

00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:06,800
I think the difference is that now you can't make companies like that per-se

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,800
you can't have companies that just like "let's sell dog food over the Internet, dog food over the cellphones"

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
but there still lot of innovation going on, I think, if you don't see the innovation maybe your head is in the sand


00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
He takes on this alpha-male personality where he's sort of like 

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,700
"I'm smarter than you, and because I'm smarter than you I'm better than you, and I can tell you what to do"

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
It's an extension of him being like a kind of torpe[?]

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
So you aggregate all these computers together and now they're solving big problems

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,000
like searching for aliens or trying to cure cancer


00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,600
First I met him on IRC, on Internet Relay Chat, he didn't just write code 

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,600
he also got people excited about solving problems, he was a connector

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
the free culture movement, which[?] had lot of his energy

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,600
I think Aaron was trying to make the world work.
He was trying to fix it


00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
He had a very kind of strong personality, that definetly ruffled[?] feathers at times

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,500
and wasn't necessarily the case that he was always confortable in the world

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
and the world wasn't confortable with him

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,900
Aaron got into high school, and was really just sick of school

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
he didn't like it, he didn't like any of the classes he had been taught

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
he didn't like the teachers

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,700
Aaron really knew how to get information

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,200
He was like, I don't need to go to these teachers to know how to do geometry

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I can just read the geometry book

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,400
and I don't need to go to the teacher to learn their version of American history 

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,800
I have like three historical compilations here like I can just read them

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
and I'm not interested in that, I'm interested in the Web


00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
I was very frustrated with school

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,300
I thought, you know, the teachers didn't know what they were talking about

[position]

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,700
they were very domineering and controlling, homework was kind of a sham[?]

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,500
I was just like, you know, all the way are penstick[?] together and force them to do busy work

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,500
and, you know, I started reading books about the history of education and how this educational system was developed

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,300
and, you know, alternative ways to do it[?] people could actually learn things 

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,700
instead of just regurgitating facts that the teachers told them

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,700
and that kind of led me down this path of questioning things

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
and once I questioned the school I was in, I questioned the society that built the school

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,200
I questioned the businesses that the schools were training people for

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I questioned the government that, you know, setup this whole structure 

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,300
One of the themes he was more passionate about was copyright, especially in those early days 

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Copyright has always been something overburden on publishing industry and on readers

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,900
but it wasn't an excessive burden

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,200
it was a reasonable institution to have in place
to make sure that people got paid

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,100
What Aaron generation experienced was the collision

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
between this antique copyright system

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,700
and this amazing new thing we were trying to build, the Internet and the Web

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,000
These things collided and what we got was chaos


00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
He then met Harward law professot Lawrence Lessig

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,700
who was then challenging copyright law in the supreme court

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,200
A young Aaron Swartz flew to Washington to listen to the supreme court hearings

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm Aaron Swartz and I'm here to listen to the Eldred ...to see the Eldred argument

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,000
Why did you fly out here from Chicago and come all this way to see the Eldred argument?

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
That's a more difficult question

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,700
I don't know, I'm very excited to see the supreme court 

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
especially in such a prestigious case as this one

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Lessig was also moving forward with a new way to define copyright on the Internet

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,800
it was called Creative Commons

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,800
So the simple idea of Creative Commons is to give people, creators

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
a simple way to mark their creativity

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,600
with the freedoms they intended to carry

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
So copyright is about "all rights reserved"

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
then this is a kind of "some rights reserved" bottle[?]

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,400
It's I want a simple way to say to you "here's what you can do with my work"

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,800
even if there are other things which you need to get my permission before you could do

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,400
And Aaron's role was the computer part

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
like how do you architect the licenses 

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,300
so that would be simple and understandable and expressed in way that machines could process it

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
And people are like, why do you have this fifteen year old kid

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,000
writing the specifications of creative commons?

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
like, don't you think that's a huge mistake?

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
and larry is like: "the biggest mistake that we would have is not listening to this kid"

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,200
embarrassing[?] is not even tall enough to get over the podium

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,300
and it wasn't one of those movable podiums

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,600
so this embarrassing thing that once he put his screen up nobody could see his face

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,000
When we come to our website here

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,500
and we've got few licences 

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,600
it gives you this list of options explaining what it means

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
and we thought three set of questions

00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
Do you want to require attribution?

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,600
Do you want to allow commercial uses of your work?

00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,700
Do you want to allow modifications of your work?

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,900
I was floored

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,800
just completely fiberglassed that these adults regarded him as an adult

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Aaron stood up there in front an whole audience full of people 

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and just started talking about the platform that he created for Creative Commons

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
And they where all listening to him, just

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,600
I was sitting AT the back thinking: 
"he's just a kid, why're listening to him?"

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,700
but they did

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
well I don't think I comprehended it fully

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Though critics have said that it does little to ensure artists get payed for their work

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
the success of Creative Commons has been enourmous

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Currently on the website flickr alone over 200 million people use some form of Creative Commons license

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,400
He contributed through his technical abilities 

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,600
and yet it was not simply a technical matter to him

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600 
Aaron Often wrote candidly in his personal blog

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,600 
I think deeply about things and I want others to do likewise.

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,800 
I work for ideas and learn from people. I don’t like excluding people. 

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,800 
I’m a perfectionist, but I won’t let that get in the way of publication.

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,300 
Except for education and entertainment, I’m not going to waste my time on things that won’t have impact. 

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,800 
I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don’t take me seriously. 

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,800
I don’t hold grudges (it’s not productive) but I learn from my experience. 

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I want to make the world a better place.

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,700
In 2004 Swartz leaves Highland Park and enrolls in Stanford University 

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
He had also diverticolite[?] which was very troubling 

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
and we were concerned about him taking his medications.

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
He got hospitalized and he would take this cocktail pills everyday

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,200
and one of these pills was a steroid which dauted his growth and 

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,600
made him feel different from any of the other students

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Aaron, I think, shows up at Stanford ready to scholarship

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,600
and find himself effectively in a baby sitting program for overachieving high school-ers

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,300
who in four years meant to become captain of industry and one percent-ers

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,600
and I think it just made him banana

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,900
In 2005 after only one year of college

<<<<<<< HEAD
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:32,200
Swartz was offered a spot at a new startup incubation firm

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,500
called Y Combinator led by Paul Graham

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,500
He's like, "hey, I have this idea for a web site"

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,200
and Paul Graham likes him enough and

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,400
so yeah, sure, so Aaron drops out of school to this apartment

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,900
So this used to be Aaron apartment when he lived here

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,00
my big memories of my father telling me how difficult it was to get a lease

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
cause Aaron had no credit and dropped out of college

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Aaron lived in what[?] called the living room

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,000
and some of the posters here are left over from when Aaron lived here

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,800
and the library, there were[?] more books then, but a lot of them are Aaron's

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,400
Aaron YCombinator site is called "infogami" a tool to build websites

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
but infogami struggles to find users

00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,600
and Swartz eventually merges his company with another Y Combinator project in need of help

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,700
it was a project led by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian called "reddit"

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,900
Now we were starting from almost nothing, no users, no money, no code

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
and growing day by day into hugely popular website

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
and it shows no sign of letting up

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,600
first we had a thousand users, than 10.000, then 20.000 and on and on, it's just incredible

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,000
reddit becomes huge and it's a real sort of geeky corner of the Internet

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,100
There's a lot of humor, there's a lot of art

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,100
and there's just people who flocked to the site

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,500
and made that site the main site they go to every morning to get their news.

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,500
"reddit" kind of just borders on chaos at some level, so on the one hand its a place for people to discuss

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,800
...news of the day, technology, politics and issues and yet there is a lot of kind of not safe for work

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,800
...material, offensive material. Some subreddits were "trolls", "find a welcome home"

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,800
and so in that sense reddit has been home to controversies as well

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
It's kind of sits on the edge of chaos. 

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,800
reddit catches the attention of the corporate magazine giant "Condé Nast"

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
...who makes an offer to buy the company. 

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,700
Some large amount of money,

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
large enough that my dad was getting bugged with questions about like

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,300
"How do I... store this money?"

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Interviewer: Like a lot of money
Noah: Like a lot of money

00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,200
Like... probably more than a million dollars. But I don't actually know.

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
And he's how old then?

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,200
Nineteen or twenty?

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:13,500
So he was in this apartment, they are like sat around on [?] couch hacking on "reddit" and...

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,300
when they sold reddit they threw giant party and then all flew out to California

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
the next day they left the keys with me.

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,800
It was funny you know, he just sold a startup so we all kind of presumed he was the richest person around...

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,100
but he.. ah.. he said "Oh, no. I'll take this tiny little shoe box sized room, that's all I need"

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:42,500
...like he was barely larger than a closet. The idea of him spending his money on fancy objects just seems so implausible. 

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,900
He explains it like, I like living in apartments,

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,900
so I'm not gonna spend lot of money on a new place to live, I'm not gonna buy a mansion

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,500
... and I like wearning jeans and t-shirt, so I am not gonna spend any more money on clothes. So like, it's really no big deal."

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,500
What is a big deal to Swartz is how traffic flows on the Internet and what commands our attention?

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,800
In the old system of broadcasting you're fundamentally limited by the amount of space in the airwaves.

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,500
You know, you could always send out 10 channels over the airwaves for televisions right away

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
even with cables you have 500 channels. On the Internet everybody can have a channel.

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,800
Everyone can get a blog or a myspace page. Everyone has a way of expressing themselves. 

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
And so what you see now is not a question of 

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,800
"who gets access to the airwaves?". It's the question of "who gets control over the ways you find people?"

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,500
You know you started seeing power centralizing in sites like Google, these sort of gate keepers< that tell you

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,500
where on the internet where you want to go. The people who provides you, your sources of news information.

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,500
So it's not you know, only certain people have a license to speak now everyone has a license to speak

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,300
It's a question of "who gets heard?"

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,700
After he started working, in San Fransico at Condé Nast, he comes into the office

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,500
and they want to give him a computer with all this crap installed on it and say that he can't

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,400
install any new things on this computer, which to a developer is outrageous, right?

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,800
From the first day he was complaining about all this sutff.

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Gray wall, gray desks, gray noise. The first day I showed up here, I simply couldn't take it.

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,800
By lunch time I had literally locked myself in a bathroom stall and started crying.

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,600
I can't imagine staying sane with someone buzzing in my ear all day, let alone getting

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,400
any actual work done. Nobody else seems to get work done either. Everybody's

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,800
is always coming into our room to hang out and chat or invite us to play the new

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,500
video game system that wired is testing.

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,600
He really had different aspirations, that were politically oriented and Silicon valley

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,600
just doesn't really quite have that culture that orients technical activity for the purposes

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,200
of political goals. Aaron hated working for a corporation. They all hated

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,100
working for Condé Nast but Aaron is like the only one who is not going to take it.

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,800
And then basically he got himself fired by not showing up to work ever.


00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,300
It was said to be a messy breakup.

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,600
Both Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman declined to be interviewed for this film

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,600
He rejected the business world 

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,100
One of the really important things to remember about 

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,800
that choice when Aaron decided to kind of leave the startup colture

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:26,100
is that he was also leaving behind the things that made him famous

00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,400
and well love and, you know, he was at risk of letting down fans

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,900
He got to where he was supposed to be going 

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,500
and had the self-awareness and honorariness to realise 

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,600
that he had climbed that mountain of shit to pluck a single rose

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,500
and discover that it lost its sense of smell

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,100
and rather than sit there and insist that it wasn't as bad as it seemed

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,200
and he did get the rose in any event, he climbed down again, which is pretty cool!

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,600
The way that Aaron always thought is that programming is magic, right

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,400
You can accomplish this things that normal humans can't by being able to program

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:13,800
so, if you had magical power, would you use them for good, or to make you mounts of cash?

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,500
Swartz was inspired by one of the visionaries he had met as a child

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,000
the man who had invented the World Wide Web: Tim Berners-Lee

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:29,000
In the 1990s Berners-Lee was arguably sitting on one of the most lucrative inventions of the 20th century

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,600
but instead of profiting from the invention of the World Wide Web

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,300
he gave it away for free.

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,400
It is the only reason the World Wide Web exists today 

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Aaron is certainly deeply influenced by Tim. 

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,400
Tim is certainly a very prominent early Internet genious who doesn't in any sense cash out.

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,800
Is not at all interested in how he's going figure out how to make a billion dollars

00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,600
People would have seen "oh, there are money to be made there"

00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,000
so there would have been lots of little webs, instead of one big one

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,400
And one little web and also which doesn't work

00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
because you can't follow links from one to the other.

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,500
Now you had to have the critial mass that this thing[?] was in the entire planet

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,600
so is not gonna work unless the whole planet can get onboard.

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,500
I am, you know, feel very strongly that it's not enough to just live in the world as it is

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,400
to just, kind of, take what you're given and, you know, follow the things that adults told you to do

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,300
and, you know, your parents told you to do and that society tells you to do

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,100
I think you should always be questioning, you know, I take this very scientific attitude

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,800
that everything you've learned is just provisional 

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,700
that, you know, is always open to recantation or refutation or questioning

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,400
And I think the same applies to society

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Once I realised that there where real serious problems, 

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,900
fundamental problems that I could do something to address

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,400
I didn't see a way to forget that, I didn't see a why not to

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,400
We just started spending a lot of time, just kind of as friends,

00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,300
We would just talk for hours in the night

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,200
I definetly should have understood that he was flirting with me

00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
I think just to some degree I was like 

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,300
"This is a terrible idea and impossible and therefore I will pretend it is not happening"

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
As my marriage was breaking down and I was really stuck without anywhere to go

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,500
we became roommates and brough my daughter over 

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,200
We moved in [?] house, it was really peaceful, like, my life had not been peaceful for a while

00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,800
and really need [?] is

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,600
We were extremely close, from the beginning of our romantic relationship

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,000
we just, we were constantly in contact

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,000
but we were both really difficult people to deal with

and moving the country in a more progressive direction

00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:01,624
to kind of come together

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,368
join our e-mail list, join our campaign,

00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,128
help get progressive candidates selected all across the country

00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:09,264
The group is responsible for igniting the grassroots efforts

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,616
behind the campaign to elect Elizabeth Warren

00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:15,160
He might have thought was a dumb system, but

00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:17,512
he came in and he said I need to learn this system

00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:20,992
'cause it can be manipulated, like any, you know, like any social system

00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:23,848
But his passion for knowledge and libraries

00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,272
didn't take a back seat

00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,270
Aaron began to take a closer look

00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:30,488
at institutions that publish academic journal articles

00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,944
A virtue of being a student at a major US univerity

00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,920
I assume that you have access to a wide variety of scholarly journals

00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:41,160
pretty much every major university in the United States

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,808
pays these sort of licencing fees

00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:46,072
to organizations like JSTOR and [?]

00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,056
to get access to scholarly journals that

00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,640
the rest of the world can't read

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,064
These scholarly journals and articles

00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:57,240
are essentlialy the entire wealth of human knowledge on-line

00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,048
and many had been payed for with taxpayer money

00:38:00,296 --> 00:38:02,040
or with government grants

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,952
but to read them you often have to pay again

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,480
handing over steep fees to publishers like Reed Elsevier

00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,048
These licensing fees are so substantial that

00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:12,990
people who are studing in India,

00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:14,792
instead of studing in the United States,

00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:16,704
don't have this kind of access

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,096
they're left out from all of these journals

00:38:19,472 --> 00:38:22,704
they're left out from our entire scientific legacy

00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:26,248
I mean, a lot of those journal articles go back to the enlightenment

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,600
everytime someone has written down a scientific paper

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,200
it has been scanned, digitized and put in these collections

00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:35,568
that is a legacy that has been brought to us

00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:38,432
by the history of people doing interesting work

00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:39,672
the history of scientists

00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:43,136
it's legacy that should belong to us as commons, as a people

00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:45,904
but instead it's been locked down and put on-line

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,448
by handful of for-profit corporations

00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:51,336
then trying to get the maximum profit as they can out of it

00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:57,288
So, a researcher by the University or the people

00:38:57,688 --> 00:39:01,016
publishes a paper and in the very very last step of that process

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,480
after all the work is done, after all the original research is done,

00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,856
the thinking, the lab work, the analysis

00:39:05,864 --> 00:39:08,232
after everything is done, at that last stage

00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:11,744
then the researcher has to handover his or her copyright

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,740
to this multi billion dollar company

00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:15,280
and it's sick!

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,864
It's an entire economy built on volunteer labour

00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:21,008
and then the publishers sit at the very top and scrape off the cream

00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,704
Talk about a scam

00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:28,936
one publisher in Britain made a profit of 3 billion dollars last year

00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:30,184
I mean, what a racket!

00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:33,944
JSTOR is just a very very small player in that story

00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:38,544
but for some reason JSTOR is the player that Aaron decided to confront

00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,720
He gone to some conference around Open Access  and Open Publishing

00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,352
and, I don't know who the person from JSTOR was,

00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:49,520
but I think they, at some point Aaron asked the question, like:

00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,048
"How much would it cost to open up JSTOR in perpetuity?"

00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,064
and they gave some... I think is 200 billion dollars

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,060
something that Aaron thought was truly ridiculous

00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,888
Working at a fellowship at Harward

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,392
he knew users on MIT's famously open and fast network next door

00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:10,328
had authorized access to the riches of JSTOR

00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:12,320
Swartz saw an opportunity

00:40:12,424 --> 00:40:14,320
You have the key to those gates

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,328
and, with a little bit of shell script magic

00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:19,864
you can get those journal articles

00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:23,576
On September 24th 2010

00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:27,112
Swartz registered a newly purchased Acer laptop

00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,544
on the MIT network, under the name Gary Host

00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:34,248
the client name was registered as "ghost_laptop"

00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:38,656
He doesn't hack JSTOR in the traditional sense of hacking

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,456
the JSTOR database was organised so

00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,088
was completely trivial to figure out

00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,440
how you could download all the articles in JSTOR

00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:45,560
because are basically numbers

00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,360
it was basically "/"  "/"  "/"  number article...

00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:52,630
...444024, and ...25 ...26

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,392
He wrote a python script called “keepgrabbing.py”

00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,072
which, was keep grabbing one article after another

00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,825
The next day ghost laptop begins grabbing articles

00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,400
but soon the computers IP address is blocked

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,400
for Swartz is barely a bump in the road

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,425
he quickly reassigns his computer IP address

00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:13,420
and keeps downloading

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,625
Well JSTOR and MIT take a number of step to try interfer with this

00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,525
when they noticed that this was happening

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,925
and when the more modest steps don't work in a certain stage they,

00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,925
JSTOR, just cuts off MIT from having access to the JSTOR database

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:33,475
so this is a kind of cat mouse game around trying to get access to the JSTOR database

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,825
Aaron ultimately obviously is the cat 

00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:42,075
because he has more technical capabilities than the JSTOR database people defending them

00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:46,765
Eventually there was a lot[?] of supplies in the basement of one of the buildings

00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,515
they whent, instead of going through WiFi 

00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,015
he went down there and he just plugged his computer directly into the network

00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,875
and just left it there with an external hard drive dowloading articles to the computer

00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:01,900
Unkown to Swartz his laptop and hard drive had been found by authorities

00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,325
they didn't stop the downloads, instead they installed a surveillance camera

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,670
They found that computer in this room in the basement of an MIT building

00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:18,740
they could have unplugged it, they could have waited for the guy to come back

00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,640
and say "Dude, what are you doing? You know, cut it out. Who are you?"

00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,640
and they could have done all this kind of stuff, but they didn't

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,905
what they wanted to do was film it to gather evidences to make a case

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,825
that's the only reason you film something like that

00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,575
At first the only person caught on the glitchy[?] surveillance camera

00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,275
was using the closet as a place to store bottles and cans

00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,025
But days later it caught Swartz
 
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:11,215
Swartz is replacing a hard drive, he takes it out of his backpack,

00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,750
leans out of frame for about 5 minutes, and then leaves

00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:42,150
And then, like, organise a [?] as he was biking home from MIT

00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:46,400
these cops came out from, like, other side of the road, or something like that, instead of going after him

00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,000
He describes that he was pressed down and assoulted by the police

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,800
he tells me that they... it's unclear[?] they were police 

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:02,100
that were after someone [?] was trying to attack him. 

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,350
He does tell me they beat him up.

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,500
He was just devastaded.

00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:14,800
The notion of any kind of criminal prosecution of anyone in our family

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,175
was so foreign[?] and uncomprensible, I didn't know what to do.

00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,315
Well they executed search warrants[?] at Aaron's house,

00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,775
his apartment in Canbdridge and his office at Harward.

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:33,625
Two days before the arrest the investigation had gone beyod JSTOR and the local Cambridge police

00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:37,150
they had been taken over by the United States secret service.

00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:42,400
The secret service begun investigating computer and credit card fraud in 1984

00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,600
but 6 weeks after attack on 9/11 their role expanded.

00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,925
President Bush used the "Patriot Act"

00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:55,350
to establish a network of what they called "Electronic Crimes Task Forces".

00:44:56,575 --> 00:45:01,500
The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists.

00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,865
According to the secret service they are primarily engaged in activities with economic impact,

00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,400
organized criminal groups or use of schemes involving new technology.

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,200
The secret service turns Swartz's case over to the Boston US attorney office.

00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,915
There was a guy in the US attorneys office

00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,175
who had the title "Head of the computer crimes division" or "task force"

00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,515
I don't know what else he had going

00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,390
but you're certainly not much of a computer crime prosecutor

00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,365
without a computer crime to prosecute, so he jumped on it

00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:35,145
kept it for himself, didn't assign to anyone else in the office or the unit

00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,015
and that's Stephen Heymann.

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,650
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann has been largerly out of public view since the arrest of Aaron Swartz

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,565
but he can be seen here in an episode of the TV show "American Greed"

00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,640
filmed around the time of Aaron's arrest

00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:53,425
he's describing his previous case against the notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez.

00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:57,040
a case that gained Heymann enourmous pretentious[?] and accolades.

00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,025
Gonzalez masterminded the theft of over a hundred million credit card and ATM numbers

00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:04,325
the largest such fraud in history.

00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:09,675
Here Heymann, decribing Gonzalez, gives his view on the hacker mindset.

00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,125
These guys are driven by a lot of the same things that we're driven by

00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:22,240
they have an ego, they like challege and of course they like money

00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,875
and everything you can get from money.

00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:27,665
One of the suspects implicated in the Gonzalez case

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,000
was a young hacker named Jonathan James

00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,115
believing Gonzalez's crimes would be pinned on him

00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,025
James committed suicide during the investigation.

00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:41,100
In an early press release describing the government's position in the case of Aaron Swartz

00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,275
Heymann's boss, US attorney for the disctrict of Massachusetts, Carmen Ortiz said this:

00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:50,165
Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar,

00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,750
and wether you take documents, data, or dollars

00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,100
It's not true. It's obviously not true.

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,790
I'm not saying it's harmless

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,475
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't criminalise stealing of information

00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,575
but you gotta be much more subtle in trying to figure out

00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:13,675
exactly which kind of  harms are harmful here

00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,525
so the thing about a crowbar is

00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,742
everytime I brake into a place with a crowbar

00:47:19,497 --> 00:47:20,708
I do damage, there's no doubt about it

00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:23,371
But when Aaron writes a script

00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,051
that says: "download, download, download" hundreds times per second

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,342
there's no obvious damage, to anybody

00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,462
If he does that for the purpose of gathering

00:47:33,577 --> 00:47:35,965
archive to do academic research on it

00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,057
there's never any damage to anybody

00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:42,685
He wasn't stealing, he wasn't selling what he got or giving it away

00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:45,634
he was making a point as for I can tell

00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,965
The arrest took its toll[?] on Swartz

00:47:48,308 --> 00:47:51,314
He just don't want to talk about it, and he's like very stressed

00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,245
if you thought like the FBI was like, going to come to your doorstep

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,982
[?] any time you went down the hall, even to do your laundry

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,388
and it would brake in to your apartment,  because you left the door unlocked

00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:07,177
like, I'd be preety stressed.
And it was clear,

00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:11,074
And so Aarorn was always sort of, like in, down on[?] mood.

00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,102
He wouldn't give up any sensitive information

00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,874
about his whereabouts during this time,

00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,382
because he was so afraid that the FBI will be waiting for him

00:48:30,948 --> 00:48:34,777
It was a time of unprecedent social and political activism

00:48:35,737 --> 00:48:39,988
Time magazine would later name as their 2011 person of the year

00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,337
"the protester"

00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:46,068
There was a kind of hotbed of hacker activity going on

00:48:48,948 --> 00:48:53,817
WikiLeaks had released a trove of diplomatic cables

00:48:53,977 --> 00:48:57,040
Manning had been under arrest at the time

00:48:57,074 --> 00:48:59,657
it was unknown whether he was the source of the leak

00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:04,697
Anonymous which is a kind of protest ensemble

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,474
that has lots of hackers in its ranks

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,440
were going on various spreeze of sorts[?]

00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:14,205
If you compare that to what he did

00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:18,091
this stuff should have been left behind for MIT and JSTOR to deal with,

00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:22,057
in a kind of private, professional matter.

00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:28,262
It should have never got to the attention of the criminal system,

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,731
It just didn't belong there.

00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:39,874
Before he was indicted, Swartz was offered a plea deal,

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,451
that involved three months in prison, time in a halfway house,

00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,257
and a year of home detention,

00:49:45,348 --> 00:49:47,508
all without the use of a computer.

00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:52,011
It was on the condition that Swartz plead guilty to a felony.

00:49:52,217 --> 00:49:56,480
Here we are, we have no discovery, no evidence whatsoever

00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,251
about what the government case is

00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,634
and we have to make this immense decision

00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:05,794
where the lawyer is pushing you do this

00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:09,714
the government is giving you a non-negotiable demand

00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:13,028
and you're told that your likelihood of prevailing is small

00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:17,485
So wether you're guilty or not you better of taking the deal.

00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:21,085
Boston has it's own computer crime division

00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:25,222
lots of lawyers, probably more lawyers than they need

00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,662
So, you know, you can imagine all sort of cases

00:50:28,674 --> 00:50:30,160
where it would be really hard to prosecute

00:50:30,182 --> 00:50:33,177
cause you've got some criminals in Russia

00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:38,260
or you've got some people inside a corporation who are gonna have $500 a hour lawyers

00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,234
or $700 a hour lawyers sitting down against you

00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,097
and then you got this case with this kid,

00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,565
which is pretty easy to prove that he did something

00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:52,525
and he has already marked himself as a troublemaker with the FBI

00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,502
so why not go as tough as you can in hearing[?] against that guy?

00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,805
It's good for you the prosecutor,

00:50:57,828 --> 00:51:02,194
it's good for the republic 'cause you're fighting all those terrorist types

00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,531
I was so scared,

00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:05,400
I was so scared of having my computer ceased

00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,200
I was so scared of going to jail

00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:10,068
because of my computer being ceased

00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:13,268
I had confidential material from sources

00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:15,260
from my previous work on my laptop,

00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:18,760
and that is above all of my priority

00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,411
is to keep my sources safe.

00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:24,697
I was so scared of what was gonna happen to Ada

00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:27,862
Aaron told me that they offered me a deal

00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:32,240
and he finally just said, that he would take it if I told him to

00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:35,862
and I came real close to saying him "take it".

00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:42,800
He had this... he had developed, like, serious political aspirations

00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:46,297
in the intervening time between when, you know, that moment

00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:51,360
when he ended that entrepreneurial startup life

00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,171
and begun this new life that had come to this political activism

00:51:57,165 --> 00:52:02,765
and he just didn't believe that he could continue in this life

00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:05,702
with a felony, you know, he said to me one day

00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:07,910
we were walking by the white house and he said to me

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,800
"they don't have felon work there"

00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,696
I mean, you know, he really wanted that to be his life.

00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:25,216
He hadn't killed anybody, he hadn't hurt anybody,

00:52:25,256 --> 00:52:27,768
he hadn't like stolen money

00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,830
he hadn't done anything that seemed felony worthy, right?

00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:36,800
and, there's this idea that, like,

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
there's no reason that he should be labeled a felon

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,800
and taken away his right to vote in many states

00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,784
for doing what he did, like,

00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:46,890
that's just outrageous, like, it makes sense for him to be

00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,208
you know, maybe fined a bunch of money or

00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,872
you know, asked not to come back at MIT again

00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,904
but like, to be a felon? to face jail time?

00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,440
Swartz turned down the plea deal

00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,824
Heymann were doubled his efforts,

00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:12,512
Heymann  continued to press us at all, at all levels.

00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,512
Even with the physical evidences

00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,100
ceased from Aaron Acer computer, hard drive and usb drive

00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:21,232
the prosecutors needed evidence of his motives.

00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:24,696
Why was Aaron Swartz downloading articles from JSTOR?

00:53:24,824 --> 00:53:27,160
and just what did he planned to do with them?

00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,096
The government claimed that he was planning to publish these,

00:53:32,464 --> 00:53:36,008
we don't really know whether that was his real intention

00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:37,832
because Aaron also had a history  of

00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:42,768
doing projects where he had analyzed giant datasets of articles

00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,048
in order to learn interesting things about them

00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:48,136
The best evidence for that is that when he was at Stanford

00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:53,192
he also downloaded the whole Westlaw legal database.

00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:55,824
In a project with Stanford law students

00:53:55,864 --> 00:53:58,664
Swartz had downloaded the Westlaw legal database

00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:00,904
he uncovered troubling connections between

00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,208
funders of legal research and favorable results.

00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:07,696
He did this amazing analysis of for profit companies

00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,040
giving money to law professors who wrote law review articles

00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:15,072
which would then beneficial to, like, Exxon, during an oil spill

00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,528
So it was a very corrupt system of funding, you know, vanity research.

00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:22,680
Swartz had never released the Westlaw documents.

00:54:22,808 --> 00:54:25,544
In theory he could have been doing the same thing about the JSTOR database

00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:27,540
That would have been completely OK.

00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,976
if he were on the other hand intending to

00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:33,040
create a competitive service to JSTOR,

00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:37,064
or gonna set up our own, you know, access to the Harward law review

00:54:37,064 --> 00:54:39,060
and charge money for it,

00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:42,024
then, you know, ok, now it seems like criminal violation

00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,810
because you're commercially trying to exploit this material

00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,272
but that's kind of crazy to imagine that's what he was doing.

00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:49,624
So, but than there's a middle case

00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:52,720
what if he was just trying to liberate for all of the developing world?

00:54:53,736 --> 00:54:55,360
But depending on what he was doing

00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,648
it creates a very different character to how the law should be thinking about it

00:54:59,184 --> 00:55:00,744
the government was prosecuting him

00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,536
as if this was like a commercial criminal violation

00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,608
like stealing a whole bunch of credit card records

00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,840
like it was that kind of crime.

00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,424
I don't know what he was gonna do with that database

00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,248
but I heard from a friend of his

00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,944
that Aaron had told him he was going to analyze the data

00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,376
for evidence of corporate funding of climate change research

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,024
that led to biased results.

00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:22,752
And I totally believe that.

00:55:25,216 --> 00:55:27,848
I was just told that Steve wanted to talk to me.

00:55:29,152 --> 00:55:32,896
and I tought maybe this is a way I can get out of this.

00:55:33,136 --> 00:55:35,016
just to exit the situation.

00:55:35,224 --> 00:55:37,824
I didn't want to leave in fear to having my computer ceased

00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:41,032
I didn't want to leave in fear to having to go to jail

00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:43,030
on a contempt of court charge if

00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,296
they tried to compel me to decrypt my computer

00:55:46,616 --> 00:55:49,456
when they came to me and said: "Steve wants to talk to you"

00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,208
that seemed reasonable.

00:55:52,864 --> 00:55:54,760
They offered Norton what is known as

00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,296
a "Queen for a day" letter or a proffer

00:55:57,576 --> 00:56:00,728
it allowed prosecutors to ask questions about Aaron's case.

00:56:00,744 --> 00:56:03,848
Norton would be given immunity from prosecution herself

00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,240
for any information she revealed during the meeting.

00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,432
I didn't like it

00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,608
I told my lawyers repeadetly that I didn't...

00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,712
this seemed de[?], I didn't like ithis

00:56:12,728 --> 00:56:14,616
I didn't want immunity, I didn't need immunity

00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:16,112
I hadn't done anything.

00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,000
But they were really really stringent

00:56:18,032 --> 00:56:21,696
thay did not want me meeting the prosecutor without immunity.

00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,928
Interviewer: just to make clear, this is a queen for a day deal proffer

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,920
Right a proffer letter

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,224
Interviewer: In which you basically handed information over them

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,312
in exchange for protection from prosecution.

00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,592
So, it wasn't handing information over,

00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:36,304
it was, at least this was how I saw, it was just

00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:38,232
having a discussion, having an inteview with them

00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:41,040
Interviewer: Well, they're asking you questions 
Quinn: They're asking me questions

00:56:41,072 --> 00:56:42,144
Interviewer: They are asking about what they want 
Quinn: Right

00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,288
Interviewer: and whatever they learned [?] prosecute for that

00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:49,352
Right, I really... right, and I repeadetly tried to go in naked

00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,536
I repeadetly tried to turn down the proffer letter

00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,520
I was ill, I was being pressured by my lawyers,

00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,712
I was confused.

00:56:57,896 --> 00:57:01,208
I was not doing well by this point

00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:02,992
I was depressed, and I was scared,

00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:05,648
and I didn't understand the situation I was in.

00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,888
I had no idea why I was in this situation

00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,312
I hadn't done anything intresting much less wrong.

00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:14,800
[?] over minds[?]

00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:17,024
Aaron was clearly very destroyed about it

00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,624
we were very destroyed about it

00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:20,952
Aaron attorneys were very destroyed about it

00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:23,432
we tried to get Quinn to change attorneys

00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:28,112
I was very unused to be in a room with large man, well armed,

00:57:28,672 --> 00:57:30,600
that are continuosly telling me I'm lying

00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:32,360
and I must have done something

00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:36,504
I told them that this thing that they were prosecuting

00:57:37,184 --> 00:57:39,936
wasn't a crime,

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,224
I told them that they were on the wrong side of history

00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:44,528
I used that phrase, I said:

00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:46,520
"you're on the wrong side of history"

00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:49,672
And they were bored,

00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:51,670
they didn't look angry, they just looked bored

00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:55,220
and I begun... it occured to me that

00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,304
we weren't having the same conversation

00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,384
I mean, I told them plenty of things about, you know,

00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,688
why people would donwload journal articles, and eventually

00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,768
I don't remember what was around it

00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,400
I mentioned he had done this blog post

00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,008
"the guerilla open access manifesto"

00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:15,608
This is the guerilla open access manifesto

00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,704
supposedly written in July 2008, in Italy

00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,560
Information is power.

00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:22,816
But like all power,

00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,872
there are those who want to keep it for themselves.

00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,264
The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage,

00:58:27,328 --> 00:58:29,496
published over centuries in books and journals,

00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:32,064
is increasingly being digitized and locked up

00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,060
by a handful of private corporations.

00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,096
Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by.

00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,496
You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences,

00:58:40,504 --> 00:58:42,614
liberating the information locked up by the publishers

00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,856
and sharing them with your friends.

00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,424
But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground.

00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:49,216
It's called stealing or piracy,

00:58:49,344 --> 00:58:52,142
as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of

00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,368
plundering a ship and murdering its crew.

00:58:54,728 --> 00:58:57,592
But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative.

00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,088
Only those blinded by greed

00:58:59,112 --> 00:59:01,320
would refuse to let a friend make a copy.

00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:04,448
There is no justice in following unjust laws.

00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,264
It's time to come into the light and,

00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:08,328
in the grand tradition of civil disobedience,

00:59:08,328 --> 00:59:11,504
declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.

00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:16,392
The manifesto itself was allegedly written by four different people

00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:18,390
and also edited by Norton

00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,168
but it was Swartz who had signed his name to it.

00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:25,248
When it's over, I go immediately to Aaron

00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,616
and tell him everything I can remember about it

00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:30,384
and he gets very angry

00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,208
The things that I'he done shouldn't have added up that way

00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,808
I hadn't done anything wrong

00:59:43,272 --> 00:59:45,224
and everything had gone wrong

00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:48,216
but I was never...

00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:58,664
I'm still angry

01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:01,864
I'm still angry...

01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,728
...try your best with these people to do the right thing

01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,576
and they turn everything against you

01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,888
and they will hurt you with anything they can

01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,816
and, in that moment, I regret that I said what I did

01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:23,216
but my larger regret is that we've settled for this

01:00:23,608 --> 01:00:25,432
that we're OK with this

01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,968
that we're ok with a justice system which [?] tries to game people

01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,568
into like traps so that they can ruin their lives

01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:35,032
So, yeah, I wish I hadn't said that

01:00:35,272 --> 01:00:41,104
but I'm much much angrier that this is where I am

01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:46,880
That this is what we as people think is OK

01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:52,232
They used every method that I think they could think of

01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:55,168
to get her to provide information which would be

01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,200
unhelpful to Aaron, and helpful to the prosecution of Aaron


01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:06,581
But, you know, I don't think she had information that was helpful to the government.

01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:12,000
Months go by as Swartz's friends and family await a looming indictment.

01:01:12,426 --> 01:01:17,376
In the meantime, Swartz was becoming a goto expert on a series of Internet issues.

01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,261
Do you think that the Intenet is something that should be considered a human right,...

01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,586
.. something that the government can not take away from you.

01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:30,624
Yes. Definately. There is this notion that national security is an excuse to shut down the Internet.

01:01:30,624 --> 01:01:34,016
That's exactly what we heard in Egypt, Syria and these other countries.

01:01:34,293 --> 01:01:38,346
And so its true. Its like Wikileaks are going to be putting up some embarassing material...

01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:39,818
..about what what the US govt does.

01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:42,506
And people are going to be organizing to protest about it and...

01:01:42,506 --> 01:01:43,808
... and try and change the government.

01:01:44,149 --> 01:01:47,946
You know, that's a good thing. Thats what all these First Amendment rights of free expression..

01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:49,952
... freedom of association are all about.

01:01:49,952 --> 01:01:55,264
And so the notion that we should try and shut them down, I think, just goes against very basic American principles.

01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:58,101
A principle, I think, is one that our founding fathers would have understood.

01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:03,306
If the Internet would have been around back then instead of putting Post Offices in the constituion they would have put ISPs.

01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:10,261
Swartz meets activist Taren Steinbrickner-Kauffman and the two begin to date.

01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:12,437
...we the massive public outcry.

01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,616
There is no massive global public outcry. It won't create any change.

01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:19,136
You know, 4 people in this city should cause a massive global public outcry.

01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:22,144
You know, we need a petition signer.

01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:27,690
Without telling her specifics, he warned her he was involved in something he called simply " the bad thing".

01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,341
And I had, sort of, crazy theories like that he was having an affair with Elizabeth Warren or...

01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,776
I speculated both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren.

01:02:38,037 --> 01:02:44,480
So sometime in probably late July Aaron called me and I happen to pick up and he said...

01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:49,856
..."The bad thing might be in the news tomorrow. Do you want me to tell you or do you want to read about it in the news.

01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:51,520
And I said, "I want you to tell me."

01:02:53,504 --> 01:03:03,232
And he said, "Well I have been arrested for downloading too many academic journal articles and they want to make an example out of me."

01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,693
And I was like, "Thats it! Thats the big fuss! Really?...

01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:11,125
...It doesn't sound like a very big deal."

01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:17,632
On  July 14th, 2011, Federal prosecutors indict Swartz on 4 felony counts.

01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:24,117
He gets indicted. On the same day 2 people in England who are part of LulzSec get arrested.

01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:29,920
And few other real hackers and Aaron is just someone who kind of looks like a hacker.

01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,082
enough that, they can like, put his head on the stakes and put it on the gates.

01:03:35,317 --> 01:03:38,794
Aaron went to surrender and they arrested him.

01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:42,336
They then strip searched him.

01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:47,413
Took away his shoelac es, took away his belt and left him in solitary confinement.

01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:54,880
The District of Massachusetts, United States Attorney's Office released a statement saying ...

01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:05,354
..."Swartz faces upto 35 yrs in prison to be followed by 3 yrs of supervised release, restitution, forefeiture and a fine of upto $1 Million.

01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,136
He was released on a $100,00 bail.

01:04:09,386 --> 01:04:17,898
The same day, the primary victim in the case JSTOR formally drops all charges against Swartz and declines to pursue the case.

01:04:18,176 --> 01:04:24,874
JSTOR, they weren't our friends. They weren't helpful or friendly to us but they also were just kind of like "We are not part of this."

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,784
JSTOR, and their parent company Ithica, sidestepped request to talk for the film.

01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:36,970
But at the time they released a statement saying it was the goverment's decision weather to prosecute, not JSTORS's.

01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:42,304
And so it was our belief that with that the case would be over.

01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:45,354
That we should be able to get Stephen Heymann to drop the case.

01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:48,175
Or settle in some rational way.

01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:50,133
And the government refused.

01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:52,053
Interviewer: Why?

01:04:55,658 --> 01:05:00,586
Well, because I think, they wanted to make an example out of Aaron and they said the reason..

01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:12,192
why they wouldnt move on, requiring a felony conviction and jail time was that they wanted to use this case as a case for deterrence.

01:05:12,192 --> 01:05:13,301
They told us that.

01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,112
Interviewer: They told you that?

01:05:14,362 --> 01:05:15,008
Yes.

01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:17,440
Interviewer: This was gonna be an example?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,877
Interviewer: He was gonna be an example?
Aaron's Father: Yes. Stephen Heymann said that.

01:05:22,154 --> 01:05:26,336
deterring who? Like there are other people running around and loggin onto JSTOR ..

01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:29,685
..and downloading the artcles to make a political statement, I mean, who are they deterring.

01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:37,450
It would be easier to understand Obama Administration's posture of supposedly being for deterrence...

01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:43,530
... if this had been Adminsitration that, for instance, prosecuted arguably the biggest economic crime...

01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:49,376
... this country has seen in the last 100 yrs.The crimes that were committed that led to the financial crisis on Wall St.

01:05:50,421 --> 01:05:58,314
When you start deploying the non-controversial idea of deterrence only selectively, ...

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,714
.. you stop making a dispassionate analysis of law breaking and you started deciding to deploy...

01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:10,709
... law enforcement resources, specifically on the basis of political ideology and ...

01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:15,573
.. thats not just undemocratic it is supposed to be Un-American.

01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:25,194
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann later reportedly told MIT's outside counsel that the straw that broke...

01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:31,240
.. the camel's back was a press release sent out by an organization Swartz founded called "Demand Progress".

01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,565
According to the MIT account Heymann reacted to the short statement of support calling it a...

01:06:36,565 --> 01:06:44,160
.. a wild internet campaign and a foolish move that moved the case from human one-on-one level to an institutional level.

01:06:44,394 --> 01:06:48,640
That was a poisnous combination. A prosecutor who didn't want to lose face...

01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:54,101
.. who had a political carrer in the offing maybe and didn't want to have this to come back and haunt them..

01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:57,898
... you spent how many tax dollars arresting someone for taking too many books out of the library...

01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:00,970
.. and got your ass handed to you in court. No way!

01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,514
I then moved to try and put pressure on MIT in various ways to get them..

01:07:05,514 --> 01:07:10,805
... to go to the government and request the government to stop the prosecution.

01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,365
Interviewer: What was MIT's reaction then?

01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:17,525
There doesn't seem to be any reaction from MIT at that point.

01:07:23,114 --> 01:07:30,602
MIT doesn't defend Aaron, which for people inside of MIT community seems outrageous.

01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:35,701
Because MIT is a place that encourages hacking in the biggest sense of the word.

01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:41,184
At MIT the idea of going and running around in routes and tunnels that you weren't allowed to be in...

01:07:41,184 --> 01:07:45,877
.. was not only a rite of passage, it was part of the MIT tour.

01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:49,952
And lock picking was a winter course at MIT.

01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:56,074
They had the moral authority to stop it in its tracks.

01:07:56,309 --> 01:08:00,789
MIT never stood up and took a position of saying to the Feds, ..

01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:07,360
"Don't do this. We dont want you to do this. You are over reacting, this is too strong." , that I'm aware of.

01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:15,680
They acted kind of like any corporation would. They helped the government and they didn't help us...

01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:21,418
... unless they felt that they had to and they never tried to stop it.

01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:25,216
MIT declined repeated requests to comment.

01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:30,208
But they later released a report saying that they attempted to maintain a position of neutrality.

01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:35,520
and believed Heymann and US Attorney's office did not care what MIT thought or said about the case.

01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:41,472
MIT's behaviour seemed really at odds with the MIT ethos.

01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:47,274
You could argue that MIT turned a blind eye and that was okay for them to do...

01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:52,757
.. but taking that stance, taking that neutral stance in itself was taking a pro-prosecutor stance.

01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:58,922
If you look at Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniack, they started by selling a bluebox...

01:08:58,922 --> 01:09:01,610
..which was a thing designed to defraud the phone company.

01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:08,949
If you look at Bill Gates and Paul Allen, they initially started their buisness by using computer time at Harvard...

01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:11,146
... which was pretty clearly against the rules.

01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:15,264
Difference between Aaron and people that I just mentioned is that Aaron wanted to make the world a better place...

01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:16,693
.. he didn't want to just make money.

01:09:19,296 --> 01:09:23,306
Swartz continues to be outspoken on variety of Internet Issues.

01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:28,597
You know  the reason Internet works is because of the competitive market place of ideas.

01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:31,925
And what we need to be focussing on is getting more information about our government...

01:09:31,925 --> 01:09:34,549
... more accessability, more discussion, more debate.

01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:38,261
But instead it seems, what Congress is foccussed on is shutting the things down.

01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:44,597
Aaron thought that he could change the world just by explaining the world very clearly to people.

01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:48,928
FLAME can literally control your computer and make it spy on you.

01:09:48,928 --> 01:09:52,021
Welcome Aaron. Good to have you back on the show here.

01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:56,373
You know, just like spies used to, in olden days, put microphones and tap what people are saying....

01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:58,784
.... now they are using computers to do the same thing.

01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:01,621
Swartz's political activity continues.

01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,848
His attention turning to a bill moving through Congress designed to curb online piracy.

01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:08,896
It was called SOPA.

01:10:09,322 --> 01:10:15,893
Activists like Peter Eckersley saw it as an enormous over reach threatening the technical integrity of Internet itself.

01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:18,218
In one of the first things I did was to call Aaron.

01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,909
And I said can we do a big online campaign against this.

01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:24,042
This isn't a bill about copyright.

01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:25,941
Its not?

01:10:26,538 --> 01:10:29,930
No, he said. Its a bill about the freedom to connect.

01:10:30,762 --> 01:10:31,808
Now I was listening.

01:10:32,426 --> 01:10:38,058
And he thought about it for a while and then said yes and he went and founded Demand Progress.

01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,480
Demand Progress in an online activism organization. We got around a million and half member now.

01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,509
But started in the fall on 2010.

01:10:47,759 --> 01:10:50,218
Aaron was one of the most prominent people in a community of people..

01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:55,338
...who helped lead organizing around social justice issues at the federal level in this country.

01:10:55,765 --> 01:10:59,968
SOPA was the bill that was intended to curtail online piracy of ...

01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,482
.... music and movies.

01:11:01,482 --> 01:11:07,180
But what it did was basically take a sledge hammer to a problem that needed a scalpel.

01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:10,549
If passed the law would allow a company to cut off finances.

01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:16,650
... to entire website without due process or even to force Google to exclude their links.

01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:20,448
All they needed was a single claim of copyright infringment.

01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,029
It pitted the titans of traditional media against the new...

01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:27,168
.. and now far more sophisticated remix culture.

01:11:27,168 --> 01:11:31,242
It makes everyone who runs a website into a policeman and if they dont do...

01:11:31,242 --> 01:11:33,888
.. their job of making sure that nobody on their site uses it for anything...

01:11:34,138 --> 01:11:38,645
... that even potentially illegal, the entire site could get shutdown without even so much as a trial.

01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:43,509
This was over the top. I mean, this was a catostrophy.

01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:49,312
This bill poses a serious threat to speech and civil liberties....

01:11:49,562 --> 01:11:51,573
.. for all who use the internet.

01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:58,570
Only handful of us who said "Look we are not for piracy either but it makes no sense to destory...

01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:03,562
... the architecture of the Internet, the domian name system and so much that makes it free and open..

01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:05,900
..in the name of fighting piracy..

01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,330
And Aaron got that right away.

01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:11,392
The freedoms guaranteed in our constitution, freedoms our country has been built on...

01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:13,845
.. would be suddenly deleted.

01:12:14,314 --> 01:12:17,941
New technology instead of bringing us greater freedom would have snuffed out...

01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:20,138
.. fundamental rights we had always taken for granted.

01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:26,858
And I realized that day talking to Peter, that I couldn't let that happen.

01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:33,365
When SOPA was introduced in October 2011 it was considered inevitable..

01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:37,354
Our strategy when it first came out was to hopefully slow the bill down...

01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:44,437
.. maybe weaken it a little bit, but even we didn't think that we would be able to stop this bill.

01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:51,669
Having worked in Washington what you learn is that typically in Washington...

01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:57,962
.. the legislative fights are fights between different sets of corporate moneyed interests.

01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:03,402
And all duking it out to pass legislations and the fights that are the closest are when you have...

01:13:03,652 --> 01:13:08,138
.. one set of corporate interest against another set of corporate interests and they are financially...

01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:11,168
... equally matched in terms of campaign contributions and lobbying.

01:13:11,168 --> 01:13:12,661
Those are the closest ones.

01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:18,442
The ones that aren't even fights, typically, are ones where all the money is on one side ...

01:13:18,485 --> 01:13:20,480
..all the corporations are on one side.

01:13:20,618 --> 01:13:22,858
and its just millions of people are on the other side.

01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:30,560
I havent seen anything like PIPA and SOPA in all my time in public service.

01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:36,832
There were more than 40 United State senators on that bill as co-sponsers.

01:13:37,557 --> 01:13:43,744
So there were already a long long way to getting 60 votes to clear all the procedural hoops.

01:13:44,682 --> 01:13:48,010
Even I began to doubt myself. It was a rough period.

01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:53,514
Swartz and Demand Progress were able to marshall enormous support using traditional outrage...

01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:59,125
.. combined with commonly used Voice over IP to make it very easy for people to call Congress.

01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:03,050
I've never met anybody else who was able to operate at..

01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:08,320
.. his level, both on the technological side and on the campaign strategy side.

01:14:08,554 --> 01:14:12,629
Millions of people contacted Congress and signed anti-SOPA petitions.

01:14:12,757 --> 01:14:14,976
Congress was caught off guard.

01:14:15,872 --> 01:14:19,221
There was just something about watching those clueless member of Congress...

01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:23,786
... debate the bill, watching them insist they could regulate the Internet and a bunch of nerds...

01:14:23,786 --> 01:14:25,109
.. couldn't possibly stop them.

01:14:25,152 --> 01:14:26,112
...I'm not a nerd.

01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:27,648
because I am not enough of a nerd.

01:14:27,712 --> 01:14:30,869
... maybe we ought to ask some nerds what this thing really does.

01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:32,896
Let's have hearing, bring in the nerds.

01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:36,394
Really?

01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:41,770
Nerds?

01:14:42,325 --> 01:14:45,802
You know, I think actually the word you are looking for is "Experts".

01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:53,290
To enlighten you, so your laws wont backfire, break the Internet.

01:14:53,376 --> 01:14:56,832
We used the term Geek, but we are allowed to use that because we are geeks.

01:14:56,832 --> 01:15:01,888
The fact that it got as far as it did without them talking to any technical experts..

01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:04,704
.. reflects the fact that there is a problem in this town.

01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:10,784
I'm looking for somebody to come before this body and testify in a hearing and say..

01:15:11,034 --> 01:15:12,085
.. this is why they are wrong.

01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:15,669
There used to be an office that provided Science and Technology advice...

01:15:15,669 --> 01:15:19,488
... and members could go to them and say "Help me understand XYZ".

01:15:19,488 --> 01:15:22,069
And Gingrich killed it. He said it was waste of money.

01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:25,717
Ever since then Congress has plunged into the dark ages.

01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:29,856
I don't think anybody thought that SOPA could be beaten, including Aaron.

01:15:30,304 --> 01:15:34,528
You think it was worth trying but it doesn't seem winable.

01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,130
And I remember, maybe a few months later, I remember him...

01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:40,032
... just turning to me and being like "I think we might win this."

01:15:40,394 --> 01:15:42,250
And I was like "That would be amazing,"

01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:49,013
Calls to Congress contiune when Domain hosting site GoDaddy becomes...

01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:54,925
... a supporter of the bill. Tens of thousnad of users transfer their Domain Names in protest.

01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,658
Within a week, a humbled GoDaddy reverses their position on SOPA.

01:15:59,658 --> 01:16:06,976
About when the Congress people that supported these record and movie industries realize..

01:16:07,226 --> 01:16:10,432
.. that there was this backlash they kind of scaled the bill back a little bit.

01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:15,893
You could see the curve happening. You could see that our arguments were starting to resonate.

01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,986
It was like Aaron had been like striking a match and he was being blown out,...

01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:20,864
.. striking another one and being blown out and finally..

01:16:21,114 --> 01:16:24,789
.. he managed to catch enough kindling that the flame actually caught and then ...

01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,873
... they turned into this roaring blaze.

01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:32,042
On January 16th, 2012, the White House issued a statement saying...

01:16:32,042 --> 01:16:33,706
.. they didn't support the bill.

01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,776
And then this happened.

01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:40,135
I'm a big believer that we should be dealing with issues of piracy and ...

01:16:40,135 --> 01:16:42,048
.. we should deal with them in a serious way.

01:16:42,773 --> 01:16:44,480
But this bill is not the right bill.

01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:48,938
When Jimmy Whales put his support towards blacking out Wikipedia..

01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,864
... the number 5 most popular website in the world..

01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:58,688
This is a website 7% of all of the clicks on anywhere on the Internet.

01:16:58,837 --> 01:17:00,117
Wikipedia went black.

01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,589
Reddit went black.

01:17:01,877 --> 01:17:02,976
Craigslist went black.

01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,112
Phonelines on Capitol Hill flat out melted.

01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,755
Members of Congress started rushing to issue statements retracting...

01:17:09,781 --> 01:17:12,961
.. their support for the bill, that they were promoting just a couple of days ago.

01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,722
Within 24 hours the number of oponents of SOPA in Congress went from this...

01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,130
to this.

01:17:22,901 --> 01:17:29,962
To see Congressmen and Senators slowly flipside throughout the day of blackout...

01:17:29,962 --> 01:17:31,349
.. was pretty unbeliveable.

01:17:31,349 --> 01:17:34,080
There was like a hundered representatives swing.

01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:38,581
And that was when, as hard as it was for me to believe after all this ...

01:17:38,581 --> 01:17:39,925
... we had won!

01:17:40,693 --> 01:17:43,936
The thing everyone said was impossible, some of the biggest companies..

01:17:43,936 --> 01:17:48,544
.. in the world had written of as kind of a pipe dream had happened.

01:17:48,992 --> 01:17:50,037
We did it!

01:17:51,253 --> 01:17:52,106
We won!

01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,954
This is a historic week in Internet politics.. maybe in American politics.

01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:02,560
The thing that we heard from people in Washington D.C,..

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,976
..from staffers on Capitol Hill was, they recieved more e-mails and more phone calls..

01:18:06,976 --> 01:18:10,581
...on SOPA blackout day than they ever recieved about anything.

01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:12,928
I think that was an extremenly exciting moment.

01:18:12,928 --> 01:18:17,770
This was the moment when the Internet had grown up politically.

01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,269
It was exhilarating because its hard to believe that it actually happened.

01:18:21,482 --> 01:18:25,472
Its hard to believe, a bill with so much financial power behind it..

01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:29,376
... didn't simply sail through the Congress.

01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:32,298
And not only did it not sail through, it didnt pass at all.

01:18:34,069 --> 01:18:39,061
Its easy sometimes to feel like you are powerless. You come out on the streets and you march and you yell..

01:18:39,061 --> 01:18:42,858
.. nobody hears you. But I'm here to tell you today: You are powerfull!

01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:48,554
Maybe sometimes you feel like you not being listened to.

01:18:48,554 --> 01:18:51,861
But I'm here to tell you that you are.. you are being listened to.

01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:56,405
You are making a difference. You can stop this bill if you dont stop fighting.

01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,404
Stop PIPA! Stop SOPA!

01:19:04,533 --> 01:19:07,370
Some of the biggest Internet companies, to put it frankly, would benefit...

01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:11,168
.. from a world in which the little competitors could get censored.

01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,048
We can't let that happen.

01:19:15,114 --> 01:19:19,125
For him it was more important to be sure that you made a small change...

01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:22,645
... than to play a small part in a big change.

01:19:23,477 --> 01:19:26,997
But SOPA was like playing a major part in a major change.

01:19:27,594 --> 01:19:30,240
And so for him it was kind of like his proof of concept.

01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:34,549
Okay, You know what I want to do with my life is to change the world.

01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:40,074
I think about it in this really scientific way of measuring my impact...

01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:42,314
.. and this shows that it is possible.

01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,472
Right, the thing that I want to do with my life is possible.

01:19:46,176 --> 01:19:50,869
I have proved that I can do it.. that I Aaron Swartz could change the world.

01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:56,352
For a guy who never really thought he had done much...

01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:57,888
.. which was Aaron.

01:19:59,381 --> 01:20:02,517
It was one of the few moments where you could really see..

01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,848
... that he had felt like he had done something good.

01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:11,392
Feeling like here is his maybe one and only victory lap.

01:20:13,717 --> 01:20:16,341
Everyone said that there was on way could we stop SOPA.

01:20:16,356 --> 01:20:22,025
We stopped it. This are 3 outrageously good victories and the year isn't over yet.

01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:25,194
I mean, if there is a time to be positive its now.

01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,845
He wins SOPA a year after he is arrested.

01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:31,978
Its not an unambigously happy moment.

01:20:31,978 --> 01:20:33,344
There is a lot going on.

01:20:33,344 --> 01:20:40,149
He is so atuned towards participating in the political process, you can't stop him.

01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:44,352
The list of organizations Swartz founded or co-founded is enourmous.

01:20:44,352 --> 01:20:48,256
And years before Edward Snowden would expose widespread Internet surveillance...

01:20:48,448 --> 01:20:50,858
.. Swartz was already concerned.

01:20:50,858 --> 01:20:55,296
It is shocking to think that accountability is so lax that ...

01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:59,106
..they don't even have basic statistics about how big this spying programme is.

01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,594
The answer is "We are spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them."

01:21:03,594 --> 01:21:05,749
Then thats a awful lot of people.

01:21:06,602 --> 01:21:10,058
One thing that they said was "Look, we know number of telephones we are spying on,

01:21:10,058 --> 01:21:12,868
..we dont know exactly how many real people that corresponds to."

01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,349
But they came back and said we can't give you a number at all.

01:21:15,349 --> 01:21:18,805
Thats pretty... I mean, that's scary is what it is.

01:21:19,055 --> 01:21:25,738
And they put incredible pressure on him, took away .. all of the money he had made.

01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,807
They threatened to take away his physical freedom.

01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:34,293
Why did they do it? Why are they going after whistleblowers?

01:21:34,543 --> 01:21:39,720
Why are they going after people who tell the truth about all sorts of things...

01:21:40,288 --> 01:21:46,197
... from the banks, to the wars, to just government transparency.

01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:51,466
So secrecy serves those who are already in power, and we are living in an era of secrecy..

01:21:51,716 --> 01:21:58,656
.. that coincides with an era where the government is doing, also, a lot of things that are probably illegal and unconstitutional.

01:21:59,722 --> 01:22:01,280
So those two things are not coincidences.

01:22:01,536 --> 01:22:06,296
It is very clear that this technology has been developed not for small countries overseas...

01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:09,925
... but right here for the use in United States by the US government.

01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:16,896
The problem with the spying programme is that its sort of long, slow expansion going back to the Nixon Administration.

01:22:16,896 --> 01:22:21,781
Obviosly it became big after 9/11 under George W. Bush and Obama has continued to expand it.

01:22:22,031 --> 01:22:26,709
The problems have slowly grown worse and worse but there has been this moment you can point to and say ..

01:22:26,959 --> 01:22:30,976
"Okay we need to galvanize opposition today because today is when it matters."

01:22:32,234 --> 01:22:41,237
The prosecution, in my estimation, of Aaron Swartz was about sending a particular laser like message to a group of people...

01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:45,504
that the Obama Administration sees as politically threatening.

01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:53,781
And that is the essentially the hacker, the information, and the democracy activist community.

01:22:54,031 --> 01:23:00,522
And the message that the Obama Administration wanted to send to that particular community was in my estimation...

01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:06,666
.." we know you have the ability to make trouble for the establishment and so were going to try to make...

01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:13,600
... an example out of Aaron Swartz. To scare as many of you as possible into not making that trouble."

01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:20,277
And the governement said "oh the legal opinions we are using to legalize the spying programme are also classified.

01:23:20,527 --> 01:23:23,498
.. So we can't even tell you which laws we are using to spy on you."

01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:28,192
Everytime they can say "Oh this is another instance of cyber war" or "the cyber criminals are attacking us agian" ..

01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,368
.. "we are all in danger, we are all under threat".

01:23:30,618 --> 01:23:33,973
They use those as an excuse to push through more and more dangerous laws.

01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:41,269
Interviewer: Personally, how do you feel the fight is going?

01:23:41,519 --> 01:23:42,890
Its upto you.

01:23:47,404 --> 01:23:52,597
You know there are sort of these two polarizing prespectives.

01:23:52,847 --> 01:23:57,013
Everything is great. Internet has created all this freedom and liberty and everythings gonna be fantastic.

01:23:57,263 --> 01:24:03,370
Or everything is terrible. Internet has created all these tools for cracking down and spying and controlling what we say.

01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,312
And I think these both are true.

01:24:06,293 --> 01:24:10,069
The internet has done both and both are kind of amazing and astonishing.

01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:12,949
And which one will win out in the long run is upto us.

01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,914
It doesn't make sense to say "Oh one is doing better than the other."

01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:17,621
They are both true.

01:24:17,728 --> 01:24:21,461
And its upto us which one we emphasize and which one we take advantage of.

01:24:21,711 --> 01:24:23,701
Because they are both there and they are always gonna be there.

01:24:29,184 --> 01:24:34,901
On Sept 12th, 2012, Federal prosecutors filed a superseeding indictment against Swartz.

01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:40,256
Adding additional counts of wire fraud, unauthorized access to a computer and Computer Fraud.

01:24:40,506 --> 01:24:45,397
Now instead of 4 felony counts Swartz was facing 13.

01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,576
The prosecution leverage had dramatically increased.

01:24:48,826 --> 01:24:51,797
As did Swartz's potential jail time and fines.

01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:55,488
They filed a seperate indictment to add more charges.

01:24:55,738 --> 01:25:01,589
And they had a theory about why this conduct constituted a number of federal crimes.

01:25:01,839 --> 01:25:05,749
And that a very significant sentence could attach to it under the law.

01:25:06,785 --> 01:25:13,984
That theory and much of the prosecution case agianst Swartz involved a law created originally in 1986.

01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,501
It is called "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.".

01:25:16,885 --> 01:25:19,914
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was inspired by the movie "War Games",

01:25:20,164 --> 01:25:21,664
with Mathew Brodrick, which was a great movie.

01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:30,133
In this movie, a kid get the ability through the magic of computer networks to launch a nuclear attack.

01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:39,840
Now that's not actually possible and certainly wasn't possible in the 80s but apparently this movie scared

01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:44,960
Congress enough to pass the original Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:53,130
This is a law that is behind the times. For example it penalises a Terms of Services kind of arrangements

01:25:53,130 --> 01:26:01,408
and something like eHarmony or match.com and somebody sort of inflates their own personal characteristic

01:26:01,408 --> 01:26:05,845
and all of a sudden depending on the jurisdiction and prosecutor they

01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,106
could be in whole host of troubles.

01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,389
We all know what Terms of Use are.

01:26:10,602 --> 01:26:16,298
Most people don't read them, but not abiding by their terms could mean you are committing a felony.

01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:20,458
The website terms of service often say things like "Be nice to each other" or..

01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,510
.."dont do anything thats improper".

01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:27,605
The idea that criminal law has anything to say about these kinds of violations,

01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,845
..I think strikes most people as crazy.

01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:33,130
The examples even get even more crazy.

01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:36,202
Untill it was changed in March, 2013.

01:26:36,202 --> 01:26:42,645
Terms of Use on the website of Seventeen Magzine said you had to be 18 in order to read it.

01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:48,768
I would say that the way CFAA has been interpreted by Justice Department, we are all probabaly breaking the law.

01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,082
Vauge and prone to misuse CFAA has become "one size, fits all" hammer ...

01:26:55,082 --> 01:26:57,792
.. for a wide range of computer related disputes.

01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:05,002
Though not the only factor in his case, 11 of 13 charges against Swartz involved the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:11,765
The question "Why?" hangs over much of the story of Aaron Swartz.

01:27:12,213 --> 01:27:15,840
Just what was motivating the goverment and what their case would have been.

01:27:16,501 --> 01:27:19,445
The Dept. of Justice declined requests for answers.

01:27:19,637 --> 01:27:23,285
But Prof. Orin Kerr is a former prosecutor who has studied the case.

01:27:23,754 --> 01:27:28,128
So I think I come about this case from a different direction than other people on a number of reasons.

01:27:28,277 --> 01:27:32,437
I was a federal prosecutor at Justice Dept. for 3 yrs before I started teaching.

01:27:32,821 --> 01:27:37,920
The govt. came forward with an indictment based on what crimes they thought were committed...

01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,402
Just as a purely lawyers matter, looking at the precedents, lookings at the statues, looking at history..

01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:48,373
.. looking at the cases that are out there so far I think it was a fair indictment based on that.

01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,573
You can debate whether they should have charged this case.

01:27:51,573 --> 01:27:52,768
There is just a lot of disagreement.

01:27:52,874 --> 01:27:56,992
Some people are on Open Access side, some people are not.

01:27:57,568 --> 01:28:03,264
I think the govt took Swartz's Guerilla Open Access Manifesto very seriously.

01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:09,813
And I think they saw him as somebody who was committed, as a moral imperative...

01:28:09,813 --> 01:28:15,488
.. to breaking the law to overcome the law that Swartz saw as unjust.

01:28:15,488 --> 01:28:20,821
And in a democracy if you think a law is unjust there are ways of changing that law.

01:28:20,821 --> 01:28:24,725
There is: going to congress as Swartz did so masterfully with SOPA or...

01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:28,458
... or you can violate that law in order to nullify that law.

01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:32,512
And I think what was driving the prosecution was the sense...

01:28:32,762 --> 01:28:39,594
... that Swartz was committed not just to breaking the law but really making sure that law was nullified.

01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:45,312
That everyone would have have access to the database in a way that you couldn't put ...

01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,381
... the toothpaste back into the tube.

01:28:47,381 --> 01:28:50,408
It would be done and Swartz's side would win.

01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:55,893
There is a big disagreement in society as to whether that is an unjust law.

01:28:55,893 --> 01:29:00,138
And ultimately thats a decision for American people to make working through Congress.

01:29:00,437 --> 01:29:03,680
And second problem is I think , we are still trying to figure out...

01:29:03,701 --> 01:29:07,754
.. whats the line between less serious offenses and more serious offenses.

01:29:07,946 --> 01:29:12,853
We are now entering that different environment of computers and computer misuse...

01:29:12,853 --> 01:29:18,442
.. .and we don't yet have a really strong sense of exactly what these lines are, because we are woking that out.

01:29:19,573 --> 01:29:22,065
This is poor use of prosecutorial discretion.

01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:28,405
The hammer that the Justice Dept has to scare people with just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:32,970
And so most people, you know, can't role dice with your life like that.

01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,661
Should we tap somebody's phone? Should we film them?

01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:39,328
Should we turn somebody and get them to testify against these other people

01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:42,421
That's how federal agents and prosecutors think.

01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:45,194
They build cases, they make cases.

01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:50,208
Swartz was caught in the gears of brutal criminal justice system...

01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,829
... that could not turn back.

01:29:52,042 --> 01:29:56,885
A machine that has made America the country with the highest rate of incarceration in the world.

01:29:57,269 --> 01:30:02,773
We have in this country allowed ourselves to be captured by the politics of fear and anger...

01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:08,021
and anything we are afraid of, like the future of the internet and access...

01:30:08,746 --> 01:30:11,925
...and anything we are angry about instinctively creates ..

01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:13,589
... a criminal justice intervention.

01:30:13,824 --> 01:30:17,453
And we have used jail, prison and punishment...

01:30:17,703 --> 01:30:20,864
.. to resolve whole host of problems that historically were never...

01:30:20,864 --> 01:30:22,741
... seen as criminal justice problem.

01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:27,626
The impulse to threaten, indict, prosecute which is part of...

01:30:27,818 --> 01:30:32,789
.. what has created this debate and contorversy over online access and information on the internet.

01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:35,477
It's very consistent with what we have seen in other areas..

01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:40,981
..one difference is people are usually targeted and victimized by these kinds of...

01:30:41,472 --> 01:30:45,333
criminal and carceral responses are typically poor and minority.

01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:50,752
Swartz's isolation from friends and family increased.

01:30:50,922 --> 01:30:53,354
He had basically stopped working on anything else.

01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:56,746
And the case was in fact taking over his whole life.

01:30:57,066 --> 01:31:00,090
One of Aaron's lawyers apparently told the prosecutors that...

01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,954
he was emotionally vulnerable.

01:31:03,204 --> 01:31:06,837
And that was something they really needed to keep in mind, so that.. they knew that.

01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,845
It was weighing on him very heavily.

01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:15,264
He did not like having his actions and movements restricted in any way.

01:31:15,514 --> 01:31:20,640
And threat of jail, which they pounded him with a lot...

01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,712
.. was terrifying to him.

01:31:23,962 --> 01:31:27,509
Completley exhausted his financial resources and ...

01:31:27,759 --> 01:31:32,032
.. it cost us a lot of money also and he raised a substantial amount of money.

01:31:32,282 --> 01:31:36,128
So, you know, it was in millions of dollars.

01:31:36,378 --> 01:31:38,197
Interviewer: The legal defence?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

01:31:38,447 --> 01:31:40,288
Interviewer: Was it millions?
Aaron's Father: Yes.

01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:44,957
Yea, I think he didn't want to be a burden to people. I think that was a factor

01:31:45,207 --> 01:31:49,546
Like I have my normal life, and I have this shitty thing I have to deal with.

01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:52,896
And I try to keep the two of them as seperate as possible.

01:31:53,146 --> 01:31:57,184
But they were just begining to blur together and everything was becoming shitty.

01:31:59,196 --> 01:32:02,410
Swartz faced a tough choice that was only getting tougher.

01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:06,741
To admit guilt and move on with your life or do you fight a broken system.

01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:12,608
With his legal case the answer was simple. He rejects the final plea deal and a trial date is set.

01:32:12,858 --> 01:32:16,106
Aaron was resolute that he didn't want to knuckle under..

01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:18,816
... and accept something that he didnt believe was fair.

01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,949
But I also think that he was scared.

01:32:32,789 --> 01:32:34,325
I don't think they would have convicted Aaron.

01:32:34,575 --> 01:32:38,549
I think we would have walked him out of that courthouse and I would have given him a big hug..

01:32:38,799 --> 01:32:42,944
.. and we would have walked across that little river in Boston and gone and had a couple of beers.

01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:51,136
I really thought that we were right. I thought we were gonna win the case. I thought we could win the case.

01:32:51,386 --> 01:32:55,840
He didn't talk about it very much but you could see the enourmous pain he was going through.

01:33:01,162 --> 01:33:06,624
No time in his childhood did Aaron have any severe mood swings, or like depressive episodes...

01:33:06,624 --> 01:33:10,592
.. or anything that I would describe to as severe depression.

01:33:10,842 --> 01:33:13,322
And its possible you know he was depressed. People get depressed

01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:24,117
Very early in our relationship, like 3 or 4 weeks in or something..

01:33:24,367 --> 01:33:29,962
.. I remember him saying to me that "I was a lot stronger than he was.

01:33:30,517 --> 01:33:36,362
You know, he was brittle in lot of ways. Things were a lot harder for him than for a lot of people.

01:33:36,405 --> 01:33:38,304
It was part of his brilliance too.

01:33:40,778 --> 01:33:47,456
I think, he probably had something like clinical depression in his early 20s...

01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:49,378
.. I don't think he did when I was with him.

01:33:49,628 --> 01:33:53,770
He wasn't a joyful person.... but that's different from being depressed.

01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:00,832
He was just under such such enourmous pressure for two years straight.

01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,816
He just didn't want to do it anymore.

01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:07,296
He was just.. I think it was too much.

01:34:13,942 --> 01:34:16,042
I got a phone call late at night.

01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:22,421
I could tell something was wrong and then I called and I realized what had happened.

01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:28,970
A cofounder of the social news and entertainment website reddit has been found dead.

01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:34,026
Police say 26 yr old Aaron Swartz killed himself yesterday in his Brooklyn apartment.

01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:46,464
i just thought we've lost one of the most creative minds of our generation.

01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,728
I was like the whole world fell apart at that moment.

01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,114
It was one of the hardest nights of my life.

01:35:00,117 --> 01:35:03,914
It was like I was screaming "I can't hear you.. what did you just say.. I can't hear you."

01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:11,765
I can't. Thats it.

01:35:19,978 --> 01:35:23,712
None of it made any sense. And really still doesn't.

01:35:24,693 --> 01:35:27,488
I was so frustrated and angry.

01:35:38,154 --> 01:35:41,120
You know I tried to explain it to my kids.

01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:46,325
My 3 yr old told me that the doctors would fix him.

01:35:52,021 --> 01:35:56,160
I know lots of people who have died but I've never lost anybody like this.

01:35:56,245 --> 01:36:03,050
Because everybody feels, and I do too, there is so much that we could've.. more to do.

01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:10,059
I just didn't know that he was there. I didn't know this is what he was suffering.

01:36:11,242 --> 01:36:13,601
He was part of me.

01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:19,328
And I just wanted it to not be real.

01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:27,989
And then I just looked at his Wikipedia page and I saw the end date.

01:36:32,065 --> 01:36:34,944
02-02-2013

01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:17,953
My first thought was what if nobody even notices.

01:37:18,805 --> 01:37:22,913
It wasn't clear to me how salient he was.

01:37:23,818 --> 01:37:29,749
I had never seen anything quite like the outpouring I saw.

01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,242
The net just lit up.

01:37:31,498 --> 01:37:39,861
Everyone was trying to explain it in their own way but I have never seen people grieve on Twitter before.

01:37:39,968 --> 01:37:42,549
People were visibily grieving online.

01:37:46,465 --> 01:37:51,253
He was the Internet's Own Boy... and the whole world killed him.

01:37:55,328 --> 01:38:00,277
We are standing in the middle of a time when great injustice is not touched.

01:38:01,962 --> 01:38:05,397
Architects of financial meltdown have dinner with the President regularly.

01:38:06,186 --> 01:38:13,568
In middle of that time the idea that this was what the government had to prosecute.

01:38:14,528 --> 01:38:17,642
It just seems absurd, if it weren't tragic.

01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:25,258
The question is can we do something, given what's happened, to make the world a better place.

01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:30,485
And how can we further that legacy. Thats the only question one can ask.

01:38:32,929 --> 01:38:38,421
All over the world there are starting to be hackathons, gatherings, and Aaron Swartz...

01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:45,034
.. has in some sense brought the best out us, in trying to say how do we fix this.

01:38:47,137 --> 01:38:54,433
He was in my humble opinion one of the true extraordinary revolutionaries that this country has produced.

01:38:54,954 --> 01:39:00,000
I don't know weather Aaron was defeated or victorious, but

01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:04,277
We are certainly shaped by the hand of the things

01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:05,877
that he wrestled with.

01:39:06,127 --> 01:39:08,692
When we turned armed agents of the law

01:39:08,821 --> 01:39:12,192
on citizens trying to increase access to knowledge

01:39:12,442 --> 01:39:14,133
we've broken the rule of law

01:39:14,383 --> 01:39:16,778
and we've desecrated the temple of justice.

01:39:17,028 --> 01:39:19,530
Aaron Swartz was not a criminal.

01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,309
Change does not role in on the wheels..

01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:25,440
.. of inevitability.

01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:27,700
It comes through continous struggle.

01:39:30,026 --> 01:39:31,690
Aaron really could do magic

01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,900
and I am dedicated to making sure...

01:39:34,095 --> 01:39:35,936
... his magic doesn't end with his death.

01:39:36,186 --> 01:39:37,664
He believed that he could change the world.

01:39:37,914 --> 01:39:39,498
And he was right.

01:39:39,748 --> 01:39:42,549
Out of the last week, and out of today..

01:39:42,799 --> 01:39:44,832
.. phoenixes are already rising.

01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:51,637
Since Swartz's death Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Sen. Ron Wyden..

01:39:51,887 --> 01:39:53,536
have introduced legislations that would reform

01:39:53,786 --> 01:39:55,370
... the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:58,741
The outdated law that formed the majority of the charges..

01:39:58,991 --> 01:39:59,936
against Swartz.

01:40:00,186 --> 01:40:02,389
It's called "Aaron's Law."

01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,802
Aaron believed that like you literally ought to..

01:40:06,052 --> 01:40:07,424
.. be asking yourself all the time..

01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:11,157
.. "what is the most thing i could be working on in the world right now?"

01:40:11,407 --> 01:40:13,269
And if you are not working on that, why aren't you?

01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:37,098
I wish we could change the past, but we cannot.

01:40:37,348 --> 01:40:43,605
But we can change the future and we must. We must do so for Aaron. We must do so for ourselves.

01:40:43,855 --> 01:40:48,469
We must do so to make our world a better place.. a more humane place.

01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,304
A place where justice works.

01:40:50,554 --> 01:40:54,272
And access to knowledge becomes a human right.

01:40:54,522 --> 01:40:59,413
So there was a kid, back in feburary from Baltimore.

01:40:59,663 --> 01:41:01,504
14 years old.

01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:08,352
..who had access to JStor and he had been splunking through JStor after reading something.

01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:13,365
And he figured out a way to do early tests for Pancreatic Cancer.

01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,037
And Pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you.

01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:22,560
Because we detect it way to late. By the time we detect its already too late to do anything about that.

01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:28,725
And, he sent e-mails off to entire Oncology department at John Hopkins..

01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:31,434
you know hundereds of them.
Interviewer: A 14 year old?

01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,610
14 year old kid yeah. And most of them ignored it.

01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,594
But one of them, like, sent him a e-mail back

01:41:35,844 --> 01:41:38,100
And said, "this is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over."

01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:43,189
This kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher and in Feburary I heard him on the news..

01:41:43,466 --> 01:41:46,794
.. just couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot.

01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,200
Sorry.

01:41:53,344 --> 01:41:58,997
And he said, the reason he was on the news is because they had done it.

01:41:59,247 --> 01:42:03,200
They were shipping an early test for pancreatic cancer that was gonna save lives.

01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:07,744
And he said, "This is why what Aaron did was so important."

01:42:10,496 --> 01:42:12,224
Because you never know, right.

01:42:12,245 --> 01:42:17,024
This truth of the universe is not only something that policy makers use to figure out...

01:42:17,274 --> 01:42:19,029
.. you know, what the speed limit should be.

01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:25,258
Its where the things thats gonna keep, your kid from dying of Pancreatic cancer comes from.

01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:31,146
And, without access the person who might come up with the thing thats got your

01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:34,901
number on it may never find that answer.

01:43:00,000 --> 01:44:59,525
