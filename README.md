The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz - 2014 - Subtitles
====================================================================

The goal
--------

We want to make this documentary accessible everywhere in the world even for people who does not speak English.

How
---

At the moment I haven't been able to find subtitles and translations for the documentary "The Internet's own boy: the story of Aaron Swartz" (contact me if they do exist).

We will divide the documentary in short 2 min sections that each of us can sign-up for.

Since the creation process is fast and can be divided more quickly than how fast I can merge a change let use this spreadsheet to 'divide & conquer':

The first part of the English subtitles are already available inside this repository. See 'TheInternetsOwnBoy_TheStoryofAaronSwartz-HD-en_US.srt'

We want to create an English version first then we'll start translating it into other languages. I will add the first draft on transifex.com for the translation.

The result is published here with a CC0 license. 

Notes
-----

If there are sections where you're unsure just leave a [?] question mark in the subtitle, others can review and fix it.

The .srt format requires a sequential number before each displayed text. Unfortunately this sequential numbers makes merges and changes more complex. Will add them at the end once we have a stable subtitle file. Players like VLC do recognize the file even without the sequence anyway so you can test your changes.

It's easy to edit subtitles manually editing the .srt file. 
There are also many sutitle editor available you can try: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_editor. 
Aegisub is a good free, open source and cross-platform option: http://www.aegisub.org/
